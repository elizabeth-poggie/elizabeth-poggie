# Presentation Notes

## Who is Affected?
This concept was actually developed in the 1970s which focused on high-achieving women. But further research revealed this is actually common regardless of age, gender, race and occupations.

In fact it disproportionately affects disadvantaged groups and minorities! I mentioned that there’s been quite a bit of research done on imposter syndrome now much more inclusively studied and we’ve read a lot of great articles from publications like the Harvard Business Review and a diverse array of authors to create this presentation today and we’ll share those articles with you attached in the slides.

## What does it mean?
1. Separate from anxiety and depression and is strongly associated with low self-confidence.
2. How come we are calling the natural human tendency of self-doubt, hesitation, and lack of confidence as “Imposter Syndrome”? (this slide leads into the next)
3. This is what it’s not, if it’s not this, what is it? Why are we calling self-doubt imposter syndrome? 

## Towards a Rigourous Definition
When the concept of imposter syndrome was developed, the impact of systemic racism, classism, xenophobia, and other biases was categorically absent. Even as we know it today, imposter syndrome puts the blame on individuals, without accounting for the historical and cultural contexts that are foundational to how it manifests in both women of color and white women. The fault of this definition directs our view toward fixing the individual rather than fixing the environments in which we work, hit it at the source
Imposter syndrome as a concept fails to capture this dynamic and puts the onus on women to deal with the effects.

Workplaces remain misdirected toward seeking individual solutions for issues disproportionately caused by systems of: 
1. discrimination abuses of power.
2. Complex relationship between individual & systemic issues that contribute to imposter syndrome

Although Imposter Syndrome is rooted in systemic issues we’d like to take a both/and approach today, sharing tools that can empower you and your peers as well as thinking about how we can fundamentally hit it at its source to have a wide-ranging positive impact on the environments we work in

## When does Imposter Syndrome Happen

### Due to Biases
1. When i say “due to biases”, im talking about feeling like you do not belong in a corporate workplace. 
2. This self doubt (and non belonging) can be even more pronounced for minorities because exclusion due to minority can really exacerbate this feeling

### Due to Toxic work Cultures
You all just started so this might not be necessarily applicable to you just yet. But it’s something to look out for. This happens in cultures that value individualism and overwork. WATCH OUT FOR THIS ONE

### Due to Crushing Expectations
Sometimes there are unreasonable standards in the workplace and the pressure to excel can become too much. Having overwhelming expectations that are not actually possible to meet can lead to feelings of imposter syndrome because you’re doubting your abilities when in reality you’re being asked to do more than is reasonably possible

###  Due to the Lack of Role Models:
What happens when someone doesn’t have anyone to look up to? For these individuals, it can exacerbate their feeling of isolation because It can be really intimidating to both be yourself when there is no one like you and also try something new.

### Due to not Being Right
What might cause this feeling in individuals is that we are in an industry there is a huge rate of change
1. Technology is evolving so much and so quickly that you can never keep up to date
2. you're constantly being tested on your knowledge, and this makes you more susceptible to the feeling

Another reason may be that you might find yourself looking to be right
1. Sometimes we spend too long searching for the "right answers", rather than focusing on the learning itself. 
2. Trial and error is the face of progress. Even if our heart aches at every mistake. Mistakes are gonna happen.

And finally what might also cause this feeling for some  is the shock from university to industry. 
1. We are transitioning from a culture where being right is the be all and end all, into an environment where curiosity and not being afraid to be wrong is an advantage. (think about your undergrad exams, assignments, that kind of deal),
2. Very often that transition occurs rapidly without any real preparation
3. As a result people still think that being wrong about an idea means you don’t deserve to be in the position that you’re in 

## Tools

It’s important to take a “both/and” approach to addressing Imposter Syndrome. (thesis: reassure the self, reassure others). We need to meet an employee’s unique needs, while also making the organizational shifts required to address imposter syndrome at its true source. Developing structural solutions that address imposter syndrome at its roots allows us to make sustainable, systemic changes that can support others who share these experiences in the long term.

Therefore to combat imposter syndrome we’ve separated it into 2 sections:
1. What can an individual do to help themselves?
2. What can a peer do to help out a friend?

# Tools for the Individual

## Documentation
**REFERENCE:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQUxL4Jm1Lo

**TOOL:** The first tool idea is Documenting your thoughts

**WHY:** it provides a personal log of what kind of thinking patterns you tend to fall into over time or patterns of mistakes that keep occurring. 

**EXAMPLE:** For example, maybe the thing that’s going wrong isn’t on you or even about you, but a lack of awareness of what’s really happening.  Documentation can help you recognize your own competence. And when i say “documenting your thoughts”, it could be as simple as journaling, writing sticky notes, or making art. There are a bunch of personal spins you can do on this. 

**CONCLUSION:** In summary, It acts as a reflection of how you are doing and also highlights underlying patterns behind the thoughts

## Fact Check Yourself

**REFERENCE:** https://www.self.com/story/reframing-existential-anxiety

**TOOL:** The next tool is Fact Check Yourself

**WHY:** Many cognitive distortions (or exasperations of self doubt) push us to believe thoughts that straight-up aren’t true, so try to get in the habit of asking yourself: WHY. This tip helps separate objective facts from emotional opinions. You can’t keep your brain from creating stories of an event, but you can center yourself around the facts of a situation. SO The next time you’re in a situation that makes you feel like an impostor, refer back to the facts vs. stories idea.

**EXAMPLE:**
1. you think: I am fearful of letting my team down
2. The next step is: well why am i afraid of letting them down
3. Maybe you are slow with resolving tickets? Maybe it’s because of the nature of feedback? Maybe there are dependencies with other teams that you didn’t expect? maybe the nature of the work is more complex? Or is it cause you are still learning. By exploring the “why” we can think about what we are capable of doing next now that we know the why. (and creating action items for ourselves to do something about this feeling)

**CONCLUSIONS:**
Separating feelings from fact can be a messy process though it allows us to see the full rainbow of events of what’s going on

## Be a Friend to Yourself

**REFERENCE:** https://www.allhealthnetwork.org/colorado-spirit/reframing-our-thoughts-to-have-positive-feelings/

**TOOL:** Ask yourself what you’d say to a friend who is having the same thought.

**WHY:** We tend to be kinder to the people we care about than we are to ourselves. Think back to the last time you engaged in negative self-talk and said things to yourself  that you’d never dream of thinking about (much less saying to) a friend. We can be really critical to ourselves.

**EXAMPLE:** Having difficulty meeting deadlines 

**CONCLUSIONS:** To conclude, when critical thoughts arise, think about how a supportive person would talk to you when going through this situation or having these thoughts. It could be a friend, a coworker, a family member, or your manager. Whoever helps support you.

## Realism

**REFERENCE:** https://www.self.com/story/reframing-existential-anxiety

**TOOL:**  Next we have Swap “finding the bright side” and finding “right and wrong” of a given situation with “finding meaning.” Basically, keeping it real.

**WHY:** We don’t choose to go through stressful situations, though we can get something of value from it.By finding value, this is not “finding the bright side of a terrible experience” or is it finding “whether i am right or wrong” in this experience. It’s about connecting to the experience with meaning without invalidating the negative feelings associated with it. 

**EXAMPLE:** 
1. Let’s say you can’t stop worrying about the long-term impact of an experience. Lets say, for example, you didn’t get promoted
2. You think: I didn’t succeed. That’s it. 
3. The next step would be: I didn’t succeed this time, but I know what I can do to improve and my manager connected me with a mentor to help me have a positive role model who can give me advice.
4. The final step: I didn’t succeed for now and I have areas for improvement, and people to support me to get me to where I want to be so I can succeed in the future..
5. This still values the emotional sentiment behind the our original phrase we started with, and it also allows you to explore the event to find parts of the event you can be grateful for and to work towards

**CONCLUSIONS:** It doesn’t cancel out your negative feelings, it’s finding meaning for these feelings and being grateful for that meaning. 

## No Comparisons

**REFERENCE:** https://www.self.com/story/reframing-existential-anxiety

**TOOL:** No Comparisons

**WHY:** Anxious thoughts can stem from comparing your situation to others—and consequently feeling uncomfortable about your situation relative to people who have a different experience than you. It’s never helpful to spiral about how you should be feeling or what you should be doing when we’re all going through something in life.

**EXAMPLE:** 
1. For example it’s easy for me to say to myself: “i shouldn’t feel this upset about the situation. Many people have gone through something similar before”. Some Examples: “why can’t i just focus” or “why do i keep breaking QA”
2. When this happens remind yourself no one has gone through the exact experiences you have and no one can compare. Everyone’s reactions are different as well and we each have our own strengths and weaknesses when confronted with a challenging situation

**CONCLUSIONS:** There’s no good to come from minimizing and invalidating your feelings. Be attentive to when you are invalidating your own emotions and wary of the people that invalidate you! Not engaging in comparisons is easier said than done, but is definitely worth trying as it can lift a lot of weight off your shoulders


# Tools as a Peer

## Talk about it
**REFERENCE:**  https://asana.com/resources/impostor-syndrome https://wappp.hks.harvard.edu/news/end-imposter-syndrome-your-workplace 

**TOOL:** Talk about it

**WHY:** Unfortunately, impostor syndrome is a common workplace phenomenon. By being the first to open up you encourage vulnerability Give it a name, its easier to work toward mediating it when we know the characteristics.

**EXAMPLE:** 
When someone shares with you feelings of imposter you can or you can recognize the feeling: Listen, understand, connect, and question 
1. Listen intently 
2. Share your own experiences
3. Highlight conditions that triggered the response in you
4. Probe your work homies for what experiences led them to discount their own success (of course only if they feel comfortable)

**CONCLUSIONS:** Being heard and validated already goes a long way in helping your peers overcome their feelings of self-doubt and imposter syndrome

## Encourage Vulnerability

**REFERENCE:** https://wappp.hks.harvard.edu/news/end-imposter-syndrome-your-workplace

**TOOL:** Encourage vulnerability and for people to be themselves.

**EXAMPLE:** 
Admit when you don’t know something no matter the level 
1. This gives a more junior person the ability to relate

Be the first to share feelings of importer
1. Hearing that a mentor suffered similar experiences can help relief the stress.
2. The best way to encourage vulnerability is to take the first step!
3. Hearing that this is a common feelings can provide the groundwork for the worker to actually collect, revisit and accept positive feedback
4. Creates an environment of trust

Be yourself
1. To encourage this, be yourself to encourage this among your peers. 
2. Imposter syndrome is essentially the fear that you are acting in your role, that you are playing the part of a successful person. Deciding to simply be yourself can help with that fear. 

## Normalizing Error

**REFERENCE:** https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/articles/feeling-like-a-fraud-impostor-syndrome-in-stem-324839

**TOOL:** Normalizing error

**WHY:** It's important to create cultures where people talk about failure and mistakes. Frame a mistake as an opportunity to learn.

**EXAMPLE:** For example, When someone makes a mistake, share with them privately your concerns if you are interested in their development.

**CONCLUSIONS:** help employees channel healthy self-doubt into positive motivation, which is best fostered within a supportive work culture.
