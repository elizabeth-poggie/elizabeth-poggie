# Quick Recap

Up to this point, we've covered the following topics in Microsoft Word:

- Key terminology
- Creating and editing documents
- Spelling and grammar tools
- Formatting and organizing text
- Inserting footnotes, endnotes, and bibliographies
- Working with graphics, images, and tables
- Adding and updating a table of contents

Today is dedicated to working on your second assignment. You already have all the tools and knowledge needed to successfully complete it.

## You have 2 options

- Stay and finish the assignment today, so you wonâ€™t have any homework for this class until mid-October, and be ready for your test
- Leave early and put off the assignment until the night it's due, giving yourself no time to prepare for the test
