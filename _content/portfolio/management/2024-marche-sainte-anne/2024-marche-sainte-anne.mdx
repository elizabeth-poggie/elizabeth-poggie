Organized three community outreach events on a four-month timeline, attracting over 10,000 participants. In my time as lead, I managed every aspect of event logistics, from securing major donations and forming key partnerships to expanding social media reach. I also led a cross-functional team of 30, successfully delivering these projects while minimizing risks to ensure smooth delivery.

# Marketing Analytics

## Insights

The following results were achieved through a modernization effort of our social media and email campaigns, which helped solidify our brand identity and strengthen our public image, deepening engagement with our core demographic. Key strategies included updating content for each platform using newly developed Brand Kits, tailoring our approach to remain competitive, and actively engaging our audience with interactive elements.

Our primary goal was to showcase the strong sense of community at the market, demonstrating that we offer more than just a place to buy vegetables. Our campaigns focused on highlighting our partners, vendors, and family-friendly activities to attract young families, positioning us as an affordable option with a strong sense of belonging.

All advertisements were created using accessible software, ensuring that the brand can be easily maintained even after my time.
