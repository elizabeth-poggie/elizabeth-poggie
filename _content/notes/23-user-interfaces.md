# Intro

So far we have been learning about the mechanics of manually creating websites and publishing a simple static website. For the rest of the course, we will skip ahead to publishing an automatically creating a website using a CMS (Content Management System).

# Content Management Systems

## What are they?

A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit, and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database (the backend) and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.

## What are we using for the course?

There are a bunch on the market that effectively do the same thing, however for the purposes of this case we are using WordPress as it is the most popular.

## How do I get started?

- Step 1) Find a server
- Step 2) Install a tool of your choice (in our case wordpress)
- Step 3) Create your WordPress site using WordPress "backend"

# Getting started

## Option 1

[Online](https://wordpress.com/) - you sign up with WordPress and you create a site on their server. Your URL will be something like: `Yourname.wordpress.org` or something like that.

This is very limited, you cannot save/create a database on the WordPress server. (e.g. lame)

## Option 2

You can "[download](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/download/)" WordPress - yes, you download it, and install it somewhere - once you do this, you can create your site wherever you installed it.

Note - this could be a big program. People do this ONLY if they want to configure their own server.

## Option 3 (What we will do for this class)

- Visit this website [here](https://www.infinityfree.com/)
- Register for the service
- Create an account
- For the "Hosting Plan", select the 0$ a month option
- For the "Domain Name", choose anything your heart desires.
- Create a password for your website.
- ... and just like that you have a website :^)
