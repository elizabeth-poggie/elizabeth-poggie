# Goal

In this lab we will develop and practice intermediate CSS layout skills by leveraging Flexbox and Responsive CSS Techniques. If you prefer to use CSS Grid, go for it !! The goal is to make your website responsive and adapt for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop devices building off of what we did last lab.

For those of you who took the time to create maintainable code last lab, you will find this lab relatively quick to do despite seeming like a lot of work. This is by design as most developer's re-use logic they use from previous projects in future work. Think like a lazy person, keep it simple and do more with less :^)

# Part 1) Value Generation (50%)

Building off of your [lab 3](./notes/lab-3-user-interfaces), your website now features an entertainment section emulating TikTok's [homepage](www.tiktok.com/en/). When a user clicks on the "Get Educated" tab of your revised nav bar:

![nav](/assets/notes/W24-user-interfaces/labs/04/New-Nav.png)

They should be redirected to the following page:

![design](/assets/notes/W24-user-interfaces/labs/04/DESKTOP-TikTok.png)

Please note that your solution does not need to be a perfect copy, however, you should aim to make it as close as possible while factoring in your particular brand styling:

Feel free to reuse any branding elements created in Lab 3 for Lab 4, work smarter not harder :^)

## Updated Requirements

- Your navbar must be constantly shown at the top of the viewport. (look up "sticky nav bars")
- Clicking on the logo should take the user to the main page (`#`)
- Clicking on any link other than "Get Educated" should take the user back to the main page (`#`)

# Part 2) Responsive Design (10%)

Implement the following breakpoints:

- Mobile: 594 px and below
- Tablet: 595px to 1076px
- Desktop: 1077px and above

And for each breakpoint, factor in the below layouts ...

# Hints

For the content and styles, re-use the work did for lab 3 to save on time.

For the component you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. If you get stuck, use Chrome DevTools.

Use this [HEX color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) if you want to steal colors from TikTok.

For icons, you can look [here](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/488230/home-3) for SVGs.
