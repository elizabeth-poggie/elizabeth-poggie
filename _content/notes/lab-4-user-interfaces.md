# Overview

- Worth: This lab will count towards the ‘lab’ portion of your final grade at 12.5%
- Due: April 16, 2024 (by ‘end of day’)
- Hand In: A `.zip` file containing your folder (work) onto LEA.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# Evaluation Criteria

## Meets Requirements

The lab meets all specified requirements as outlined in the given instructions.

Considerations:

- Have you thoroughly reviewed all lab details before final submission to ensure compliance with requirements?
- Have you clarified any ambiguities or uncertainties regarding the lab requirements before proceeding with your submission?

## Code Quality

This aspect evaluates the overall quality of the code. High-quality code should be well-structured and easy to understand.

Consideration:

- Are variable names descriptive and meaningful?
- Are error handling mechanisms informative, providing meaningful feedback to users?
- If modularization is possible, is it implemented effectively, ensuring clear separation of concerns and minimal coupling between sub-components?
- If a design pattern can be leveraged, is it applied correctly and in alignment with the intended use case, enhancing code maintainability and extensibility?

## Best Practices

The code follows established coding conventions and standards, promoting scalability, reliability, and maintainability over time.

Considerations:

- Are variable names consistently written in `camelCase` format?
- Does the code maintain consistent indentation and formatting throughout?
- Are comments used effectively to explain complex sections of code or document important decisions?
- Have you minimized code duplication?

## Logic

The code logic should be clear, concise, and logically sound to ensure proper functioning with minimal complexity. Embracing simplicity often leads to elegant solutions.

Considerations:

- Have you optimized your solution to be as simple as possible while still meeting requirements?
- Can any parts of the code be made more concise without sacrificing functionality or readability?

## Bugs

There are no additional defects, errors, or issues present in the code.

Considerations:

- Have you tested your solution, including edge cases, to ensure the program doesn't crash?
- If your solution involves user interaction, have you implemented input validation?

## Creativity Bonus

The code takes an innovative and original approach. Creativity in software development can manifest in various ways, such as unique interface designs, unconventional problem-solving approaches, innovative algorithms, or novel functionalities that enhance user experience or efficiency.

Considerations:

- Did you demonstrate out-of-the-box thinking?
- Did you incorporate your own touch into the solution?
