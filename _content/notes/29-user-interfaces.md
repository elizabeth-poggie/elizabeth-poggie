Your website could go down at any point for a variety of reasons:

## Option 1

Install `Updraft`:

- Once here, search for `Updraft` in the `Search plugins...` textbox
- Select the option `UpdraftPlus: WordPress Backup & Migration Plugin` with 3+ Million Active installations
- Select `Install` and then click `Activate`

Manual Backups:

- Navigate to your `Installed Plugins` page and select the `Settings` of `Updraft`
- Select `Press here to start`, this should redirect you to a `Settings` page with the title `UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore`
- Select `Backup Now`
- Wait a few moments for `Updraft` to work it's magic
- Under `Existing backups`, your current backup should be listed underneath :)
- And now you have a backup incase anything goes wrong :)

Automatic Backups:
