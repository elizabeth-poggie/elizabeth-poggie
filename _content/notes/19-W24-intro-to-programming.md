# What is WPF?

This stands for "Windows Presentation Foundation" and is a UI framework for creating Windows desktop applications.

## Some Examples?

- Flowgorithm
- Visual Studio
- VSCode
- ... and so much more

## Why do i care?

Working with console applications is cool and all however let's bring it to the next level. What are common UI elements that you use on a daily basis?

- Text boxes
- Buttons
- Animations

## How do i get it?

It's built into `.NET` and is compatible with all the C# code you have written so far.

## How is it built?

Uses Extensible Application Markup Language (`XAML`) to create UI Elements.

Take this C# snippet for example:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World")
```

in `XAML` it would look like this:

```xaml
<Grid>
    <TextBlock>Hello World</TextBlock>
</Grid>
```

## Look familiar?

If you have worked with `yaml` or `html` this will look very similar
