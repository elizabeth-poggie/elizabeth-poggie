# In-class Competition

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

The first team to successfully navigate through [User Inyerface](https://userinyerface.com/) will receive a prize.

Should any team finish before the class is over, you can leave early. HOWEVER, to put into perspective, I have not been able to do this myself. SO if no team completes the exercise, the team that progresses the farthest before the class is over will be declared the winner.

Good luck, and may the UI gods be ever in your favor :^)

## NOTE

Any attempt to Google the answers or seek assistance from ChatGPT will result in immediate disqualification. This challenge is meant to test your problem-solving abilities ðŸ‘€
