The exercises in these directories, are shared with minor modification from [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) ([MIT License](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/blob/main/LICENSE))

## Instructions

These exercises were written as a series of CSS related tasks intended to complement the HTML and CSS content on TOP. We will use them to complement the course content in our course as well.

When doing these exercises, please use all course documentation and online/offline resources you need to accomplish them. You are _not_ intended to have any of this stuff memorized -- with practice you will become more familiar with these properties naturally.

## How To Use These Exercises

For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work. Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to make sure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.

Make your edits in the `index.html` and/or the `style.css` files in order to make the output in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s). Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.

I will (eventually) provide solutions for these exercises Keep in mind that the solutions I provided are not the only solutions. If your solution differs wildly, but still passes the self-check criteria, feel free to ask about me about it (or your classmates! Feel free to ask things at any time).

## Some Hints

Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact
pixel value for things like margin, padding and font-size. These exercises are
intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess that a
screenshot is using `font: sans-serif bold 16px`, or that the margin is
_exactly_ `42px`.

You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right
spot. (For the first few exercises we make it explicit when this needs to
happen.)

You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file. The first few exercises
have almost everything already done for you, but as you progress you'll find
that you need to add more and more to get the correct result.
