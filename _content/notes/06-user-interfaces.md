# Instructions

## Fonts

- download 3 of free-to-use fonts. Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof `@font-face` code.
- Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.

## Font Styling

```html
<h1>Style me please</h1>
<h2>and me!!!</h2>
... and me as well !!
```

- Give the page a site-wide `font-size` of `10px`
- Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable relative unit.
- Give your body text a suitable `line-height`. (Between about 1.4 and 1.6 is ideal)
- Give your headings a little bit of `letter-spacing`
- Give the first paragraph after each heading in the `section` a little bit of text-indentation, say 20px.

## Link Styling

```html
<a>I need a special style</a>
<a>how will you decide my styling when i am hovered?</a>
```

- Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states a different color each
- Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them, the underline disappears.
- Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.
- Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.

## Bonus points ðŸ‘€

- Bonus points for all those that manage to find a way to cause an image to disappear on button click
