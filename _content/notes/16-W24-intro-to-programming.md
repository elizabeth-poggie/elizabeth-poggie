# Scope of a variable

A variable only exists inside of the method in which it is declared and it does not exist in any other method.

```cs
public static void method()
{
	string var = "I exist only inside of this method";
	var = "and upon method ending, my existence is terminated";
}
```

In other words, the scope of a variable the part of the code where it exists.

## Example

If i try to run the below code snippet

```cs
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		Console.WriteLine(s);
	}
	public static void method()
	{
		string var = "This is my scope";
	}
}
```

I should see the following

```text
ERROR!
/tmp/VwTJp3aEqf.cs(10,21): error CS0103: The name 's' does not exist in the current context
```

## Top down processing

When inside a method:

- a variable starts to exists when it is declared, and
- it ends to exists at the close curly bracket corresponding to the most recent open curly bracket.

```cs
public static void method() { // enter the method
	int num = 42; // variable begins it's life
	num++; // the variable does things during it's existence
} // variable is destroyed, rip variable
```

# Mini Quiz

## Q1

Will it run?

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	int y = 6;
	int z = x + y;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ YES, `int y` is in scope

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	int y = 6; // scope
	int z = x + y; // scope
}
```

## Q2

Will it run?

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	int z = x + y;
	int y = 6;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ NO, `int y` is NOT in scope

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	int z = x + y;
	int y = 6; // scope
}
```

## Q3

Will it run?

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	{
		int y = 6; // scope
		int z = x + y; // scope
	}
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ YES, `int y` is in scope

## Q3

Will it run?

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	{
		int y = 6;
	}
	int z = x + y;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ NO, `int y` is NOT in scope

```cs
public static void method() {
    int x = 5;
	{
		int y = 6; // scope
	}
	int z = x + y;
}
```
