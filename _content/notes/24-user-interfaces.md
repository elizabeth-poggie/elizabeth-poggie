# WordPress - Frontend vs Backend

The front end of your site is the part that is exposed to the world. It is what you want your public to see. Example: [www.johnabbott.qc.ca](www.johnabbott.qc.ca) this is what students/the world sees.

The back end is for "employees" of the company to work on the website. Through this portal, you can/will modify the website. For example: [www.johnabbott.qc.ca/admin](www.johnabbott.qc.ca/admin)

## Updating information

Updating department information on a WordPress site shouldn't inherently take too long, as it's usually a matter of logging in, making the necessary changes, and hitting 'Publish'.

# Customizing your Theme

Building on the example from last class, let's navigate to the [admin panel](poggies-cool-shop.great-site.net/admin), then select appearances then themes. Here you can select a new template to build off of :^)

Don't like it? Pick another.

# Edit a Page

## Option 1) From the page

Let's navigate to the main page and select the "Edit Page" tab in the top bar. This should open up the page editor view. Wordpress pages are divided into "Blocks", by hovering over the content you can see what "type" the block has.

To get an overview of all the blocks in the page, click the "List View" icon

```text
___
 ___
  ___
```

Make some changes and click the "Update" button. The changes should now be live on the main page :)

## Option 2) From the admin panel

Let's navigate to [All Pages](http://poggies-cool-shop.great-site.net/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page) and here you can see everything that is active. What happens if we ever want to change a page?

- Hover over the page you want to change
- Update the content
- now click "Update"

Changes will also be reflected

# Adding Media

Let's click the "+" icon to add a block, pattern, and media. Choose your fighter and edit away.

# Creating Patterns

Let's click a group of blocks that are nested together and create a pattern. We can now reuse this pattern on our other pages to save on time.
