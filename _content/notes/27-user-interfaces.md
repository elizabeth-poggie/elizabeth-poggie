# Avoiding Git Commands

Don't like running `git` commands? VSCode has your back :^)

# Getting started

Open up your VSCode and select the option `Clone Git Repository` from the start screen and paste the below link into your terminal

```text
https://github.com/elizabeth-poggie/user-interfaces-2024.git
```

Select the destination for the repo. On my side, i like to store my repos like this:

```text
lab4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repos
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-interfaces-2024
```

Notice how in the bottom left corner, you are in the `main` branch. However merging code to main is bad practice and bad news, so lets work some magic ü™Ñ

# Branches

Click the bottom left corner that contains `main`, this should open up a display that allows you to create a new branch or change your branch. You should see something like this:

```text
-------------------------
+ create new branch
+ create new branch from
checkout detached
-------------------------
...
main
```

## Creating Branches

- Select the option `+ create new branch`
- create a new branch name
- ...and voila, now the bottom left corner contains your new branch name letting you know that you are in a new branch :)

## Publishing branches

Although your "Local Repository" knows that you have a new branch in the repo, it's time to let the "Remote Branch" know.

- Navigate to the "Source Control" option on the left hand side of your VSCode
- Click the option "Publish Branch" and boom just like that you are in business

# Committing && Pushing

Whenever you are creating files or changing files, it's good to periodically save your work so you don't lose any progress. Once you are ready to commit the changes to your "Remote Repository", follow these simple steps:

- Navigate to the "Source Control" option on the left hand side of your VSCode.
- Click the file you've changed, this will open up a view to see how the code compares from before and after. Usually you need entire tools to get this behavior, however it's built in with VSCode.
  - Notice you can still edit your code in this view as well
- Press the `+` icon on the files you want to "Stage". Alternatively, you can select all of them from the top to "Stage All Changes"
- Enter a commit message to describe what those changes mean
- Now click the "Commit" button to get them ready to push.
- Once clicked, that same button should change to say "Sync Changes #"
- ... and just like that you committed and pushed code exclusively with clicking buttons

# Exercise ‚ù§Ô∏è

As an exercise:

- create a branch with your student number
- under `src` create the file `<your student number>.html` and add whatever content you desire
- commit and push those changes

# Merging changes

Let's say that the `main` branch changed since the last time you `pull`ed your changes. To update your branch:

- Navigate to the "Source Control" option on the left hand side of your VSCode.
- Select the `...` option
- Navigate to `Branch` and select `Merge`
- It will prompt you to select which branch to merge from, in our case select `main`
- Now your "Local Repository" has reflected those changes, to have the "Remote Repository" reflect those changes, click the "Sync Changes #" button

# Resolving Merge Conflicts
