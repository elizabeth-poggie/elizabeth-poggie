# Goal

Building off of your labs 3 and 4, your Hackathon project is ready to venture into the realm of e-commerce. This phase involves crafting a straightforward website using WordPress, following the guidance listed in [these setup instructions](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/23-user-interfaces#getting-started). Compared to our previous Labs, you will find this relatively easy to work with :)

# Milestone 1 (15%) - Due May 7th

## Navigation

Your website should contain a navbar with a home page, about page, and reviews page. Each of these links should cover the below requirements...

## Theme Customization

Use the Wordpress Theme Selector to select a theme. Read the CSS for that theme and make changes as you see fit. When you make your own personal changes, document that with comments in the CSS and follow the below resources to learn how it's done:

- [Step by step guide on How to Edit CSS & HTML in WordPress](https://www.theme-junkie.com/how-to-edit-css-in-wordpress/)
- [Wordpress.org CSS documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/css/)
- [Wordpress.org Themes documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/)
- [Wordpress Site Design & Layout documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Site_Design_and_Layout)

## Home Page

In your home page, you should have content that contains:

- Your vision
- Your target audience
- Your inspiration
- Your impact

Information should be logically organized for each section with images to make it a bit more interesting. You can source your images from:

- [This canadian specific stock photo library](https://www.cira.ca/en/stock-gallery/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Your own photos
- ... or stuff you found online, however be sure to give credit where credit is due :^)

## About Page

Pitch yourself.

- What do you value?
- What motivates you?
- What do you like doing?
- Who do you want to become?

Some ideas to get you started

- [Matt Damon](https://water.org/about-us/founders-board-team/matt-damon/)
- [Dolly Parton](https://dollyparton.com/)

... and feel free to hype yourself up :^) There's no shame in highlighting your strengths and showing off what you've got.

## Reviews Page

Solicit feedback from your peers on your project and labs. There is no limit to how many comments you should have, however aim to have at least 5. Each comment should contain:

- A quote
- A photo or the avatar of the commentator
- The commentators name and occupation (And yes you can give each other fake job titles)

Some idea's to get you started:

- "WAY too salty and there's too much plastic and i mean it. also, i've gotten stranded on 143 too many deserted islands. i do not recommend the north pacific ocean. also way too cold, they really need to pay their electric bill." - [Laurel, Google Reviewer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZXzFqnvBh2CtJGv8)
- "too much water!! i called an uber to drive me there, and they started saying things like ‚Äúplease, i have a family‚Äù, and ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what you mean!‚Äù overall bad experience." - [Deez, Ocean Anarchist](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6NYV5kVP1BofNwq5)
- "Lot of water" - [Soren, Ocean Enthusiast](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mnexhSKP5916kW9i6)

# Milestone 2 (15%) - Due May 16th

## Merch

Create a new page called "Merch" and ensure this page is linked to your navbar. On this page, you should sell products related to your site‚Äôs concept. Some ideas to get you started:

## Shopping Cart Requirements

You must implement a shopping cart ‚Äì yes, use a plugin for this - and also link the page on your navbar. Please make sure your shopping cart has links to PayPal and Visa, as well, ensure navigation is correct and easy once the purchase is made.

## Theme toggler

Create a ‚ÄúChange theme‚Äù button that allows you to select a new custom theme from a list. Some ideas to get you started:

- A dark mode, the background turns black with white text
- 90s mode, the look and feel of the website is reminiscent of [this cardboard cup](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/HT_paper_cup_jef_150624_16x9_1600.jpg).
- 70s mode, all images now encapsulate [this energy](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/9d/99/c29d9973384c0dfbc3a5e74247a98b86.jpg).

There should be at least 3 unique themes to choose from and the button should be easily accessible from the navbar.
