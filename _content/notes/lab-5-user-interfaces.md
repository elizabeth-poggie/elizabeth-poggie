- "too much water!! i called an uber to drive me there, and they started saying things like “please, i have a family”, and “i don’t know what you mean!” overall bad experience." - [Deez, Ocean Anarchist](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6NYV5kVP1BofNwq5)
- "Lot of water" - [Soren, Ocean Enthusiast](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mnexhSKP5916kW9i6)
