In this project you will develop a simple website using WordPress following [these setup instructions](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/23-user-interfaces#getting-started). Compared to our previous Labs, you will find this relatively easy to work with :)

Some idea's to get you started:

- "WAY too salty and there's too much plastic and i mean it. also, i've gotten stranded on 143 too many deserted islands. i do not recommend the north pacific ocean. also way too cold, they really need to pay their electric bill." - [Laurel, Google Reviewer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZXzFqnvBh2CtJGv8)
- "too much water!! i called an uber to drive me there, and they started saying things like “please, i have a family”, and “i don’t know what you mean!” overall bad experience." - [Deez, Ocean Anarchist](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6NYV5kVP1BofNwq5)
- "Lot of water" - [Soren, Ocean Enthusiast](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mnexhSKP5916kW9i6)
