# Question 1 (3 points)

## Question

Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external specificity

## Answer

- Inline - Since there is no selector for inline CSS, there is no specificity to calculate; inline CSS rules automatically beat all other CSS rules for this reason. [Read more here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/14-user-interfaces#inline-css)

- Internal - Specificity here is determined by ordering. [Read more here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/14-user-interfaces#internal-and-external-css)

- External - Same deal as above

# Question 2 (2 points)
