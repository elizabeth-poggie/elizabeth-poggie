# What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is an event where software developers, designers, and other tech enthusiasts, come together to collaboratively work on software projects. These events are usually centered around a specific theme or goal, and participants form teams to brainstorm ideas, develop prototypes, and often create fully functional software or hardware solutions within a very strict time frame.

## Why run a Hackathon?

Hackathons encourage creativity, innovation, and teamwork, and they often feature competitions with prizes for the best projects. Participants may work on anything from mobile apps and websites to hardware devices or even non-software solutions like business plans or social initiatives, for the purpose of this class though, we will stick to creating a simple website.

## How do you win?

To win, you need to impress the judges with your project's creativity, technical execution, and potential impact at solving real world problems... so how do you do that? Let's break it down into steps.

# Step 1) What are you trying to do?

What are you trying to solve?
How is your solution better than other possible solutions?
What message is your solution conveying?

What to ask yourself:

- Is this solution for yourself?
- Is it for a friend?
- Is it for your family? Your community?
- Or are you trying to solve a global problem?

Thinking about your target audience is essential because this will inform you on your motivation behind your solution. Only then will you will be able to decide how to start designing and developing your strategy. When we solve problems, it's not a thoughtless process. We need to think about "who" we are doing this for because a solution for me may not be a solution for you or for larger groups.

# Step 2) Crafting your Vision

Now that we know our target audience, you need to think about the constraints in which you are developing your idea.

What to consider:

- How much effort will solving this problem take? How long will it take?
- What is the meaningful impact of the vision?
- How do we demonstrate the magnitude of the work required is proportional to the magnitude of the impact? (e.g. Will this even pay off? Is it worth the time and effort?)
- How can we be sure if we address these problems, we won't run into even more problems later down the line?
- What is the risk associated with the input and output of the vision? For example, will it actually take the time we are allocating to the task or will it take longer?
- At what point do we actually make a difference? What is the first milestone where we start seeing that our hard work is actually paying off?

At the moment, we only have basic HTML knowledge, some JavaScript experience, and limited CSS foundations. Given these constraints and the limited time frame we have to work with, how will you design your vision?

# Step 3) How do you implement your vision?

Now that we know the "who" we are solving this problem for and and "what" we are aiming to make, we need to start thinking about "how" we are going to do it.

What to think about:

- Will your solution benefit from user interaction? (e.g. JavaScript)
- Will this need a special design? (e.g. custom CSS, we are building a BRAND here.)
- Will this have a specific layout? (e.g. special HTML semantics, how are we captivating our audience?)
- What other resources do we have available to us to work with? (e.g. what materials from your other classes can we blend into this work)

We are building VISION here, using tools beyond this class is encouraged because the best kind of problem solving is one that leverages creativity && innovation. Keep in mind, there may be MANY tools in your tool belt for developing a vision, however sometimes a more complex tool may not be the best strategy. Beauty can be found in simplicity, it's about staying true to the problem we are trying to solve.

# Step 4) What is the impact of our vision?

Is your solution memorable? Are you actually solving the problem at hand? Will your message be received by your target audience? Who else may your solution be impacting?

What to keep in mind:

- A bad solution that is memorable is better than an average solution that is forgettable.
- We may strive for perfection in our solutions ALTHOUGH sometimes purposely being horrendous may actually be the correct strategy.

Keep in mind, it's about your VISION, your TARGET AUDIENCE & staying true to what you are trying to solve.

# In class Exercise

## The Problem

TBD

## Activity Phase

- Get into groups of sizes 2 or 3.
  - One person needs to be in charge of communicating your solution to the class.
  - One person needs to design the idea and/or help with development.
  - One person needs to be in charge of development.
- You have 10 minutes to come up with a solution to the problem in your group
- Then you have 30 minutes to develop the solution.
- Afterwards we will regroup.

## Regrouping Phase

Share a few words about:

- Your vision
- Your target audience
- The solution's impact
- and how this follows best HTML && JavaScript best practices :)

# Next week

... returning to CSS land where we learn about FLEX & GRID !!
