# What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is an event where software developers, designers, and other tech enthusiasts, come together to collaboratively work on software projects. These events are usually centered around a specific theme or goal, and participants form teams to brainstorm ideas, develop prototypes, and often create fully functional software or hardware solutions within a very strict time frame.

## Why run a Hackathon?

Hackathons encourage creativity, innovation, and teamwork, and they often feature competitions with prizes for the best projects. Participants may work on anything from mobile apps and websites to hardware devices or even non-software solutions like business plans or social initiatives, for the purpose of this class though, we will stick to creating a simple website.

## How do you win?

To win, you need to impress the judges with your project's creativity, technical execution, and potential impact at solving real world problems... so how do you do that?

## Let's break it down into steps

- Step 1) figure out what you are trying to do
- Step 2) craft your vision
- Step 3) develop your implementation strategy
- Step 4) evaluate your impact

# Step 1) What are you trying to do?

What are you trying to solve? How is your solution better than all other possible solutions? What message is your solution conveying?

## What to ask yourself

- Is this solution for yourself?
- Is it for a friend?
- Is it for your family? Your community?
- Or are you trying to solve a global problem?

Thinking about your target audience is essential because this will inform you on your motivation behind your solution. Only then will you will be able to decide how to start designing and developing your strategy. When we solve problems, it's not a thoughtless process. We need to think about "who" we are doing this for because a solution for me may not be a solution for you or for larger groups.

# Step 2) Crafting your vision

Now that you know your target audience, you need to think about the project you want to make.

## What to consider

- How much effort will solving this problem take? How long will it take?
- What is the meaningful impact of the vision?
- How do you demonstrate the magnitude of the work required is proportional to the magnitude of the impact? (e.g. Will this even pay off? Is it worth the time and effort?)
- How can you be sure if you address these problems, you won't run into even more problems later down the line?
- What is the risk associated with the input and output of the idea? For example, will it actually take the time we are allocating to the task or will it take longer?
- At what point do you actually make a difference? What is the first milestone where you start seeing that your hard work is actually paying off?

At the moment, you only have basic HTML knowledge, some JavaScript experience, and limited CSS foundations. Given these resources and the limited time frame, how will you develop your vision?

# Step 3) What is the Implementation Strategy?

Now that you know the "who" you're solving this problem for and and "what" you're aiming to make, we need to start thinking about "how" you are going to do it.

## What to think about

- Will your solution benefit from user interaction? (e.g. JavaScript)
- Will this need a special design? (e.g. custom CSS, we are building a BRAND here.)
- Will this have a specific layout? (e.g. special HTML semantics, how are you captivating your audience?)
- What other resources do we have available to us to work with? (e.g. what materials from your other classes can we blend into this work)

You are building VISION here, using tools beyond this class is encouraged because the best kind of problem solving is one that leverages creativity && innovation. Keep in mind, there may be MANY tools in your tool belt for developing a vision, however sometimes a more complex tool may not be the best strategy.

Beauty can be found in simplicity, it's about staying true to the problem you are trying to solve and who you are solving it for.

# Step 4) What is the Impact?

Is your solution memorable? Are you actually solving the problem at hand? Will your message be received by your target audience? Who else may your solution be impacting?

## What to keep in mind

- A bad solution that is memorable is better than an average solution that is forgettable.
- We may strive for perfection in our solutions ALTHOUGH sometimes purposely being horrendous may actually be the correct strategy.

The quicker you do things that are HIGH IMPACT, the quicker you build trust with your TARGET AUDIENCE.

## You need to be clear about risk for trust to work.

Unexpected results, changes, and setbacks are part of life, how are you managing those expectations? How do you communicate potential changes? What is the timing in which we communicate those changes?

# In-Class Exercise

## The Problem

A bunch of students are stressed out and need a way to relax while studying for exams. What website can those students go to that will help them unwind?

## Some initial ideas to get you started

- a random quote generator
- a meme gallery
- a simple web game
- ...or something completely different? Google anything and everything that you think could help :^)

## Grouping Phase (5 minutes)

Get into groups of sizes 3 or 4.

- One person needs to be in charge of communicating your project to the class.
- One person needs to design the idea and/or help with development.
- One person needs to be in charge of development.

## Planning (15 minutes)

Brainstorm ideas and plan your projects.

## Implementation Phase (60 - 90 minutes)

Develop your project in groups. If any single member of the group finishes their tasks early, they must act as support to the other members of their group.

## Presentation Phase (30 minutes)

Afterwards we will regroup where a member of each group will need to present their project to the class and communicate the following points:

- Your vision
- Your target audience
- How your group's solution is unique
- The solution's impact
- ...and how this follows HTML semantics, CSS best practices && utilizes effective JavaScript :)

## Evaluation Phase (5 minutes)

- The project that solves the problem at hand, follows best practices, and has the highest impact will receive a prize.
- Runner up will receive a smaller prize :^)
