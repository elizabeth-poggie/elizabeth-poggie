# Intro

Forms are the primary interactive component of websites. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used immediately on the browser to update the interface.

For this lecture, we will stick to the basics and in later classes you will cover server-side and client-side JavaScript related logic for forms.

# Basic structure

Forms are made of 4 primarily components:

- One `<form>` container element that wraps all other child `<form>` elements.
- One or more `<input type="">` element where users "inputs" data.
- An `<input type=submit>` element or a `<button>` element to trigger form submission.
- `<label>` elements that visually identify `<input>` elements. (we love accessibility)

For example:

```html
<form action="/yeet-data">
  <label for="nameF">Username</label>
  <input type="text" name="nameFirst" id="nameF" />

  <label for="nameL">Password</label>
  <input type="text" name="nameLast" id="nameL" />

  <input type="submit" value="Login in" />
</form>
```

should give the following basic layout:

```text
Username
 ________________________
|________________________|

Password
 ________________________
|________________________|

 ________________________
|                        |
|         Log in         |
|________________________|

```

Look familiar? You can find this snippet of logic implemented on practically every website you have visited today alone. Let's look at each element in detail...

# Form Element

The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input:

```html
<form>
  <!-- other stuff -->
</form>
```

However the above example is still useless as it does nothing and sends nothing.

If you want the form to send data, you need to include it's most important attribute `action="..."`, which defines the URL of where to send the data.

```html
<form action="/yeet-data">
  <!-- other stuff -->
</form>
```

The URL usually points to a server-site script, in this case "/yeet-data" which will parse the data (categorize it) and store it. You will explore that fun stuff later on :^) problems for future you!!

However the form is still useless as it still does nothing. How do we fix this? This is where the next most important attribute `method="..."` comes into play, this specifies the HTTP method you intend to use when the form is submitted (GET or POST).

```html
<!-- This will send && receive requests to the current URL declared in the parent form element -->
<form method="get">
  <!-- other stuff -->
</form>
<!-- other stuff -->
<form method="post">
  <!-- other stuff -->
</form>
```

But what does "GET" mean? What does "POST" mean? For now what you need to know is:

- "GET", retries data
- "POST", sends data

Another way to think of this concept is that you want to put a message in an old school envelope, you're either sending it to a specific address or receiving it from one. Similarly, in our case, the 'address' corresponds to a URL where the 'server' or 'backend' resides, and the 'method' indicates whether we're sending ('POST') or receiving ('GET') data.

```text
‚úâÔ∏è -- POST --> üóÉÔ∏è @ url

‚úâÔ∏è <-- GET -- üóÉÔ∏è @ url

```

But what does this data look like? Well it depends:

- With a GET method the data is submitted and visible in the URL bar (i.e. to the user).
- With a POST method, the data is encoded in the `html` request body and can be encrypted (with `https`).

As a general rule: always use POST if the form data contains sensitive information.

We always strive to make our info more confidential, especially when it's personal.
This practice ensures that even if someone attempts to intercept your 'POST' request, they'd need mad IQ skills to decrypt the sensitive info sent to the server. Going back to our message analogy, imagine if someone tried to scan your risque envelopes or screenshot your private texts, your haters would need mad EQ skills to understand the nuances of your communication. (Stay bothered, we love verbal boundaries)

```text
‚úâÔ∏è -- POST -- (your haters) --> ‚ù§Ô∏è (your loved ones)
```

What are other relevant attributes? It depends on the use case, the full docs can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attributes)

Cool, so we have have a way to decide how data is sent and received. We also know how to send it, but now how do we account for user input? Let's get into it :^)

# Input Element

Allowing for user input looks like this:

```html
<input />
```

You will notice that by default, the `input` element creates a basic single-line text field. This is due to the adaptability of the `<input>` element, which can be presented in various formats depending on the `type` attribute. In its default state, the type attribute is set to `type="text"`.

## Text inputs

```html
<!-- Text Input: for short text or alphanumeric data -->
<input type="text" placeholder="I am a cool text input" />

<!-- Password Input: for securely entering passwords -->
<input type="password" placeholder="I contain secrets ü§´" />

<!-- Search Input: for searching within a website or application -->
<input type="search" id="search" name="search" placeholder="Search" />
```

## Select inputs

```html
<!-- Checkbox Input: for selecting multiple options -->
<input type="checkbox" id="option1" name="option1" value="option1" />
<label for="option1">Option 1) Cute cat</label><br />
<input type="checkbox" id="option2" name="option2" value="option2" />
<label for="option2">Option 2) Cute dog</label><br />

<!-- Radio Input: for selecting one option from multiple -->
<input type="radio" id="radio1" name="radioGroup" value="option1" />
<label for="radio1">Option 1</label><br />
<input type="radio" id="radio2" name="radioGroup" value="option2" />
<label for="radio2">Option 2</label><br />
```

## Numeric inputs (including date && time)

```html
<!-- Number Input: for entering numerical values -->
<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10" />

<!-- Date Input: for selecting dates -->
<input type="date" id="birthday" name="birthday" />

<!-- Time Input: for selecting times -->
<input type="time" id="appt" name="appt" />
```

## File inputs

```html
<!-- File Input: for uploading files -->
<input type="file" id="fileUpload" name="fileUpload" />
```

## ... and more

Are there more options? [Yes lol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input). Use them wisely depending on the project

# Labels

The `<label>` element associates a text caption with an `<input>` field. Going back to our original example:

```html
<label for="nameF">Username</label>
<input type="text" name="nameFirst" id="nameF" />
```

is what creates this look:

```text
Username
 ________________________
|________________________|

```

## Why labels?

Using `<label>` for `<input>` has two major advantages compared to other text elements we are familiar with

- Screen readers can read out the label when the user is focused on the form input.
- Clicking on the label will focus/activate the input.

# Dropdowns

The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list of options. For example:

```html
<label for="pet-select">Choose a pet:</label>

<select name="pets" id="pet-select">
  <option value="">-- Wow! Look at all these options!! --</option>
  <option value="cat1">Cat</option>
  <option value="cat2">Cat</option>
  <option value="cat3">Cat</option>
  <option value="cat4">Cat</option>
  <option value="cat5">Cat</option>
</select>
```

Here the `<option> ... </option>` tags inside the `<select>` element define the available options in the drop-down list.

# Trigger Submission

## There are two ways of triggering a form submission...

Immediately after an `<input>` of `type=button` is clicked inside a `form`

```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="submit()" />
```

Immediately after a `<button>` element is clicked inside a form
As far as the form is concerned both methods are functionally the same.

```html
<button type="submit" onclick="submit()">
  <i>Submit</i>
</button>
```

The main advantage of the button is that this element can take other elements inside, such as icons or images.

# Putting it all together

```html
<form action="/yeet-data">
  <!-- Form which will send a GET request to the current URL -->
  <form method="get">
    <label>
      First name:
      <!-- Notice the placeholder text -->
      <input name="submitted-name" placeholder="Arthur" />
    </label>
    <button>Save</button>
  </form>
  <br />
  <!-- Form which will send a POST request to the current URL -->
  <form method="post">
    <label>
      Middle name:
      <!-- Notice the disabled attribute -->
      <input name="submitted-name" disabled />
    </label>
    <button>Save</button>
  </form>
  <br />
  <!-- Form which will send a POST request to the current URL -->
  <form method="get">
    <label>
      Last name:
      <!-- Notice the readonly attribute -->
      <input name="submitted-name" readonly placeholder="Dent" />
    </label>
    <button>Save</button>
  </form>
  <br />
  <!-- Form with fieldset, legend, and label -->
  <form method="post">
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Do you agree to the terms?</legend>
      <label><input type="radio" name="radio" value="yes" />YES</label>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="radio" value="no" />Absolutely not</label
      >
    </fieldset>
  </form>
  <br />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="submit()" />
</form>
```
