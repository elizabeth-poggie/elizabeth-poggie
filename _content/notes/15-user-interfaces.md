# In-Class Hackathon

The theory of CSS Specificity is one thing. Putting it into practice is a completely different beast. The reality is that most of you are going to be working in older code bases with the CSS that is the developer equivalent to Spaghetti.

How many of you have been tasked with untangling christmas lights for the holidays? Yes, it's like that.

Very few people in this world find that experience pleasurable. I am one of them, which is why i am teaching this class lol.

let's begin :^).

# The Problem

Despite being a website used by over 10 000 students on a daily basis, Omnivox hasn't received an update in the last 15 years. Now it's your job to fix it.

## The Tool

Download this [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)

## Some initial theme ideas to get you started

- a Studio Ghibli theme?
- Hollow Knight???
- Genshin Impact?
- Replace all the images with memes?

## Grouping Phase (2 minutes)

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

- Together you need to develop the one style sheet to rule them all.
- As a general word of advice: divide and conquer. Split different components of the page amongst yourselves to drive home the final design For example, one person can tackle the side bar, one does cards, and another does links. Afterwards, combine all the separate sheets into one final design.
- This task is impossible to complete without teamwork. To put it in perspective, it took me three hours last night just to develop the layout alone.

## Planning (5 minutes)

Brainstorm ideas and divide the tasks.

## Implementation Phase (60 - 90 minutes)

Bring your idea to life. Any one member of the group that finishes their component first needs to act as support to complete the un finished tasks.

## Presentation Phase

In this google doc, attach the following:

- A screenshot of your final product
- Your team name
- Your vision
- The inspiration
- Who will benefit from the solution

Our Monday class will begin where I review each of your projects "Simon Cowell" style. May the odds be ever in your favour :^)

## Evaluation Phase (5 minutes)

- The team that has the most complete design, most creative solution, and has the potential to be used by the largest number of students will receive a prize.
- Runner up will receive a smaller prize :^)

# Responsive Design

Have you ever been on a website that sucks to use? When you were trying to access my notes on mobile, was it annoying to use?

Any creative trade requires both technique (HTML, CSS) as well as design. So what is responsive web design?

# What is it

We are using HTML and CSS to achieve an ambitious goal: we want not just make any web page, but web pages that render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while retaining usability and function. That is, responsive web design is the set of best practices used to create universally usable webpages.

```text
"With great power [to create websites], comes great responsibility
[to make them accessible to all users, regardless of device]."

- Uncle Ben, Spider-Man (2002), with minor adaptions.
```

# Exercise 1

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 3 or 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

The first team to successfully navigate [this website](https://userinyerface.com/) will receive a prize. To put into perspective, I have not been able to do this myself. SO if no team completes the exercise, the team that progresses the farthest will be declared the winner.

You have a maximum of 30 minutes.

Good luck :^)

# DevTools Responsive Mode

Getting good at any approach to HTML/CSS requires being able to debug our code and measure our success in achieving a design. Like in previous topics we have learned, modern internet browsers come with a suite of very useful tools for debugging and measuring â€“ for responsive design, most browsers have a responsive design mode tool.

## What can you see in DevTools

- Simulate a mobile devices
- Simulate varying device widths
- Show media queries
- Different devices have different resolutions. In DevTools, you can actually simulate different device pixel ratios.

## QUIZ: Can we do this in DevTools?

- Capture what the user sees when they try to take a screenshot of our website?
- See what a screen rotation does to our website?
- Can we simulate a Desktop device that is also a touch screen?
- Sometimes we try to access pages on a website and the WIFI sucks, can we simulate that on Chrome?
- What happens if we are located in South Korea, can we see what this will look like on our website?

# Exercise 2

Complete [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode). In my time at Morgan Stanley, SSENSE && MaintainX, the tools featured in the tutorial were a regular part of my workflow and a requirement to use prior to shipping any feature.

You have 20 minutes and we will continue the lecture.

Have fun :^)
