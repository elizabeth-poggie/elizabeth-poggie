# In-Class Hackathon

The theory of CSS Specificity is one thing. Putting it into practice is a completely different beast. The reality is that most of you are going to be working in older code bases with CSS that is the developer equivalent to Spaghetti.

How many of you have been tasked with untangling christmas lights for the holidays? Yes, it's like that.

Now let's get started.

# The Problem

Despite being a website used by over 10 000 students on a daily basis, Omnivox hasn't received an update in the last 15 years. Now it's your job to fix it.

## The Tool

Download this [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha). This tool allows you to change the appearance of any web page instantly :)

## Some initial theme ideas to get you started

- a Studio Ghibli theme?
- Hollow Knight???
- Genshin Impact?
- Replace all the images with memes?

## Grouping Phase (2 minutes)

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

- Together you need to develop the one style sheet to rule them all.
- As a general word of advice: divide and conquer. Split different components of the page amongst yourselves to drive home the final design For example, one person can tackle the side bar, one does cards, and another does links. Afterwards, combine all the separate sheets into one final design.
- This task is impossible to complete without teamwork. To put it in perspective, it took me three hours last night just to develop the layout alone.

## Planning (5 minutes)

Brainstorm ideas and divide the tasks.

## Implementation Phase (Just this class)

Bring your idea to life. Any one member of the group that finishes their component first needs to act as support to complete the un-finished tasks.

## Submission (before monday morning latest)

In this google doc, attach the following:

- A screenshot of your final product
- Your team name
- Your vision
- The inspiration
- Who will benefit from the solution

Our Monday class will begin where I review each of your projects "Simon Cowell" style. May the odds be ever in your favour :^)

## Evaluation Phase (Monday)

- The team that has the most complete design, most creative solution, and has the potential to be used by the largest number of students will receive a prize.
- Runner up will receive a smaller prize :^)
