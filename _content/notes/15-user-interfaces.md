# Exercises on CSS Specificity

Despite being a website used by over 10 000 students on a daily basis, Omnivox has not received an update in the last 15 years. Now it's your job to fix it.

## Some initial theme ideas to get you started

- a Studio Ghibli theme?
- Hollow Knight???
- Genshin Impact?
- Replace all the images with memes?

## Grouping Phase (5 minutes)

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 3 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

- Together you need to develop the one style sheet to rule them all.
- As a general word of advice: divide and conquer. Split different components of the page amongst yourselves to drive home the final design For example, one person tackles the side bar, one does cards, and another does links. Afterwards, combine all the separate sheets into one final design.
- This task is impossible to complete without teamwork. To put it in perspective, it took me three hours last night just to develop the layout alone.

## Planning (5 minutes)

Brainstorm ideas and plan your projects.

## Implementation Phase (60 - 90 minutes)

Develop your project in groups. Any one member of the group that finishes their component first needs to act as support to complete the un finished tasks.

## Presentation Phase (~10 minutes each)

Afterwards we will regroup where a member of each group will need to present their project to the class and communicate the following points:

- Your vision
- Your inspiration
- WHo will benefit from this solution
- ...and how the sheet was built :)

## Evaluation Phase (5 minutes)

- The project that solves the problem at hand, follows best practices, and has the highest impact will receive a prize.
- Runner up will receive a smaller prize :^)

# Responsive Design

Have you ever been on a website that sucks to use? When you were trying to access my notes on mobile, was it annoying to use?

Any creative trade requires both technique (HTML, CSS) as well as design. So what is responsive web design?

# What is it

We are using HTML and CSS to achieve an ambitious goal: we want not just make any web page, but web pages that render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while retaining usability and function. That is, responsive web design is the set of best practices used to create universally usable webpages.

```text
"With great power [to create websites], comes great responsibility
[to make them accessible to all users, regardless of device]."

- Uncle Ben, Spider-Man (2002), with minor adaptions.
```

# Exercise 1

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 3 or 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

The first team to successfully navigate [this website](https://userinyerface.com/) will receive a prize. To put into perspective, I have not been able to do this myself. SO if no team completes the exercise, the team that progresses the farthest will be declared the winner.

You have a maximum of 30 minutes.

Good luck :^)

# DevTools Responsive Mode

Getting good at any approach to HTML/CSS requires being able to debug our code and measure our success in achieving a design. Like in previous topics we have learned, modern internet browsers come with a suite of very useful tools for debugging and measuring â€“ for responsive design, most browsers have a responsive design mode tool.

## What can you see in DevTools

- Simulate a mobile devices
- Simulate varying device widths
- Show media queries
- Different devices have different resolutions. In DevTools, you can actually simulate different device pixel ratios.

## QUIZ: Can we do this in DevTools?

- Capture what the user sees when they try to take a screenshot of our website?
- What a screen rotation causes our site to look like?
- Can we simulate a Desktop device that is also a touch screen?
- Sometimes we try to access pages on a website and the WIFI sucks, can we simulate that on Chrome?
- What happens if we are located in South Korea, can we see what this will look like on our website?

# Exercise 2

Complete [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode). In my time at Morgan Stanley, SSENSE && MaintainX, the tools featured in the tutorial were a regular part of my workflow and a requirement to use prior to shipping any feature.

You have 20 minutes and we will continue the lecture.

Have fun :^)
