# Exercises on CSS Specificity

Despite being a website used by over 10 000 students on a daily basis, Omnivox has not received an update in the last 15 years. Now it's your job to fix it.

## Some initial theme ideas to get you started

- Dark mode
- Studio Ghibli
- Hollow Knight? Genshin Impact?
- You could replace all URLS with memes
- or could Lea benefit from CSS animations instead?

## Grouping Phase (5 minutes)

Get into groups of any size of your choosing with a max of 4 people. If you prefer to work independently that is also an option.

- Together you need to develop the one style sheet to rule them all.
- As a general word of advice: divide and conquer. Split different components of the page amongst yourselves to drive home the final design (e.g. one person tackles the side bar, one does cards, and another does links.). Afterwards, combine all the separate sheets into one final design.
- This task is impossible to complete without teamwork. To put it in perspective, it took me three hours last night just to develop the layout alone.

## Planning (5 minutes)

Brainstorm ideas and plan your projects.

## Implementation Phase (60 - 90 minutes)

Develop your project in groups. Any one member of the group that finishes their component first needs to act as support to complete the un finished tasks.

## Presentation Phase (~10 minutes each)

Afterwards we will regroup where a member of each group will need to present their project to the class and communicate the following points:

- Your vision
- Your inspiration
- WHo will benefit from this solution
- ...and how the sheet was built :)

## Evaluation Phase (5 minutes)

- The project that solves the problem at hand, follows best practices, and has the highest impact will receive a prize.
- Runner up will receive a smaller prize :^)
