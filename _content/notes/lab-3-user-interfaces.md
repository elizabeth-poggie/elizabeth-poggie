# Goal

In this lab we will develop and practice intermediate CSS layout skills by leveraging Floats and Flexbox. Our goal is to bring designs to life :)

# Part 1) Landing page (80%)

You are a junior developer at a startup and a product manager has tasked you with creating a feature for your company's new community page. The deadline is tight, with launch scheduled in 10 days time. Unfortunately, there was no prior consultation with the developers for time estimation, and the deadline cannot be altered as it has already been guaranteed to shareholders.

The designer has provided you with the following design:

<!-- TODO: insert Design -->

You must get your feature as close to the design as possible.

However, your company prioritizes legal compliance and wants to avoid potential lawsuits. Therefore, it recommends sourcing images for the community page from reputable platforms such as [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) as they provide free-to-use images.

If you plan to use memes in your work however, nothing risks a lawsuit faster than ignoring copyright laws. Consequently, you must give credit to the original creators if required. We always strive to minimize lawsuit potential in our work, as nothing jeopardizes job security faster than legal complications :^)

# Question 2) Troubleshooting (20%)

Oh no! The feature requirements changed 3 days before launch! Your product manager got some tea from sales and now needs to modify the feature to appeal to higher-paying clients. As a result, the designer has made the following changes:

<!-- TODO: insert Design -->

An intermediate developer has provided you with some starter code to help you out, this code will turn the hamburger icon in the top-right of the webpage into a theme-toggler. Once this is working, you should add the following `styles.css` to your project:

<!-- TODO: insert CSS -->

This stylesheet will allow you to easily identify the structural elements of your web page.

In addition to the other `style.css` rules, you must adapt the styles to include:

- Flex containers should be identified with a border of solid color (ex.: red, green, blue, yellow, purple, etc).
- Flex items should be identified with a dashed or dotted border.
- An item can be a Flex container and item at the same time. In this case it will have a colored border that is dashed or dotted.
- Block level elements / Float elements that are not inside Flex items or containers will have a black solid border.
