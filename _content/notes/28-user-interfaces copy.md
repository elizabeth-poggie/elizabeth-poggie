Installing `WooCommerce`:

- Navigate to the `Plugins` tab and select `Add New Plugin`
- Once here, search for `WooCommerce` in the `Search plugins...` textbox
- Once loaded, you should see the `WooCommerce` plugin as one of the first results. You will notice that there are 5+ million active installations and over 4 thousand reviews. This is how you know you have the legitimate plugin :^)
- Select `Install` and then click `Activate` now you are ready 2 rumble :^)

Activating `WooCommerce`:
