# WooCommerce

This let's you sell stuff on your wordpress website :)

## Backing up your wordpress website

Generally it's best practice to backup your wordpress website before adding new themes and installing new plugins.

This helps you prevent loosing all your work when you make edits to your website :^)

## Getting started

Installing `WooCommerce`:

- Login to the backend of your wordpress website
- Navigate to the `Plugins` tab and select `Add New Plugin`
- Once here, search for `WooCommerce` in the `Search plugins...` textbox
- Once loaded, you should see the `WooCommerce` plugin as one of the first results. You will notice that there are 5+ million active installations and over 4 thousand reviews. This is how you know you have the legitimate plugin :^)
- Select `Install` and then click `Activate` now you are ready 2 rumble :^)

Activating `WooCommerce`

- Once active, navigate to the `Settings` page.
- This is where we will need to fill out information about your store.
