# Domain Names

This is your website's address and you can get your own :)

# Domain Managers

In 2023, Google cut a deal with Squarespace, transferring all of their domain registration rights. In a press release, Google's VP and GM of merchant shopping, said the sale is an effort to “sharpen our focus.” HOWEVER, based on online assessments, the deal's value is estimated at $180 million USD. I encourage the class to apply their critical thinking skills to discern the underlying motives behind this deal :^)

## Where to buy?

You will notice that when you try to access [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar/?pli=1), it will redirect you to [Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/?channel=bd&subchannel=google-domain&campaign=&subcampaign=&source=google_domain_referral&utm_source=google_domain_referral&utm_medium=bd&utm_content=google-domain&utm_term=&utm_campaign=). Here is where you can look into purchasing your own domain.
