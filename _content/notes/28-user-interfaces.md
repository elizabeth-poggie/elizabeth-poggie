# Domain Names

This is your website's address and you can get your own :)

# Domain Registration

In 2023, Google cut a deal with Squarespace, transferring all of their domain registration rights. In a press release, Google's VP and GM of merchant shopping, said the sale is an effort to “sharpen our focus.” HOWEVER, based on online assessments, the deal's value is estimated at $180 million USD. I encourage the class to apply their critical thinking skills to discern the underlying motives behind this deal :^)

## Where to buy?

You will notice that when you try to access [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar/?pli=1), it will redirect you to [Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/?channel=bd&subchannel=google-domain&campaign=&subcampaign=&source=google_domain_referral&utm_source=google_domain_referral&utm_medium=bd&utm_content=google-domain&utm_term=&utm_campaign=). Here is where you can look into purchasing your own domain.

Alternative resources that allow you to buy your own domain include:

- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca)
- [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?gad_source=1)
- [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/)
- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/)
- ... and more !!

## How much do they cost?

The cost of domains can vary widely depending on several factors such as the domain extension (e.g., .com, .net, .org), the registrar you purchase from, any additional services or features bundled with the domain registration, and whether the domain is considered premium or standard.

```text
CHEAPEST ($10 - $50 per year)
.com

MID-TIER
.gov .edu

EXPENSIVE (+ $1,000 per year)
.inc
.io
.co
```

For example `poggie.ca` might cost $0.01 per year, however `pogie.com` might cost $16,464 per year. Costs vary widely and more premium names come at a pretty penny.

# Domain Linking

Once purchased, you will likely need to wait for DNS to create a record of your domain name. Once finished, now let's work some magic
