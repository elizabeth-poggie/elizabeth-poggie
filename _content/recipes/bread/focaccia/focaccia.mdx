# Long Instructions

## Dough Formation

- Combine the yeast, honey, and water.
- Let it sit for about 5 minutes.
- Add flour and salt in a seperate bowl.
- Combine together and mix until a “shaggy dough” forms. It should have a consistency similar to mud that feels unpleasant to the touch. (this is what success sounds like)

## First Rise

- Pour enough olive oil into a large bowl to coat the dough generously, then place the dough inside. Flip it a few times to ensure it’s well-coated.
- For average results, cover and leave it on the countertop for about 4 hours. For superior results, cover and refrigerate for up to a day. (the choice is yours)

## Dough Modification

- Once the dough has doubled in size, it’s time to deflate it.
- Use a fork to gather the edges of the dough furthest from you, lifting and folding them towards the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat this process twice or until the dough is smaller.
- Butter a baking sheet and pour a little olive oil in the center. Place the dough ball onto the oiled pan.

## Second Rise

- For average results, let the dough rise in a warm spot for about 1.5 hours. For better results, let it rise in a warm spot for 4 hours. (Depends on your level of hunger!)
- When you’re ready, preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C)

## Dough Finalization

- Once preheated, dimple the focaccia all over with your fingers. It should feel like you’re aggressively playing the piano
- Add any desired toppings or customizations
- Bake for 18–24 minutes or until the bottom is golden brown
- eat and enjoy
