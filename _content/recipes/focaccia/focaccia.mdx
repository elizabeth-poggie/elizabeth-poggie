# Ingredients

- 6 g active dry yeast (like an envelope)
- 14 g honey
- 592 g water
- 625 g all-purpose flour
- 6 g table salt
- enough olive oil
- some butter

# Instructions

- combine yeast, honey, and water
- wait like 5 minutes
- add flour and salt
- wang jangle until a "a shaggy dough" forms. Something akin to the consistency of gloopy mud with no lumps and unpleasant to the touch. (this is what success sounds like)
- pour enough olive oil to smother your dough in a large bowl and plop your dough inside. Flip it a few times to ensure its been adequetly smothered.
- for mediocre results, leave covered on counter top for about 4 hours. for try hard results, leave covered in fridge for like a day (the choice is yours)
- once doubled in size, now its time to COVER a baking pan in butter
- pour enough olive oil in the center of the pan for the dough to plop onto
- prior to plopping the dough from the bowl, we first need to deflate it. To do this, use a fork and gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quater turn and repeat the process like 2 times or until its smaller.
- u are now ready to yeet the dough onto the pan (do tht)
- for average results, let it rise in a warm spot for like 1.5 hours. for better results, let it rise in a warmer spot for 4 hours (depends how hungry u are)
- once hungry, preheat the over to 450 F
- Next, dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano
- Bake for 20–30 minutes until golden brown
