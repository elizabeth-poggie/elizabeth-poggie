- once doubled in size, notw it's time to defalte it a bit
- to do this, use a fork and gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quater turn and repeat the process like 2 times or until its smaller
- next, COVER a baking sheet in butter and pour enough olive oil in the center of the pan for the dough to plop onto
- plop the dough ball

## The Second Rise

- for average results, let it rise in a warm spot for like 1.5 hours. For better results, let it rise in a warmer spot for 4 hours (depends how hungry u are)
