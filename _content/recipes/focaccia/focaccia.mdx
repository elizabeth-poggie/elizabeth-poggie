- 14 g honey
- 592 g water
- 625 g all-purpose flour
- 6 g table salt
- enough olive oil
- some butter

# Instructions

## Dough Formation

- combine yeast, honey, and water
- wait like 5 minutes
- add flour and salt
- wang jangle until a "a shaggy dough" forms. Something akin to the consistency of gloopy mud with no lumps and unpleasant to the touch. (this is what success sounds like)

## First Rise

- for mediocre results, leave covered on counter top for about 4 hours. for try hard results, leave covered in fridge for like a day (the choice is yours)

## Dough Modification

- once doubled in size, now it's time to defalte it
- to do this, use a fork and gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quater turn and repeat the process twice or until its smaller
- next, COVER a baking sheet in butter and pour enough olive oil in the center of the pan for the dough to plop onto
- plop the dough ball in the pan

## Second Rise

- for average results, let it rise in a warm spot for like 1.5 hours. For better results, let it rise in a warm spot for 4 hours (depends how hungry you are)
- once hungry, preheat the oven to 450 F

## Dough Finalization

- once preheated, dimple focaccia all over with your fingers (you should feel like you’re aggressively playing the piano)
- add customizations if desired
- bake for 20–30 minutes or until golden brown
- eat and enjoy
