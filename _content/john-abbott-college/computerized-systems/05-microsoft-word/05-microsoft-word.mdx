Use the above `Dictate` function for voice to text functionality.

## Clear Formatting

Let's say you made a lot of different changes to the document and want to revert the styles back to the original state. You could hit "Undo" a whole bunch OR you could simply highlight the area of text you want to revert and click the "clear style" button:
