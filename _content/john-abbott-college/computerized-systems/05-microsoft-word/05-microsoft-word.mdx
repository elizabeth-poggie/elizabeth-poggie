# Keyboard Shortcuts

For virtually everything you can do with a mouse, you can do FASTER with a keyboard shortcut. This class we are going to learn how to use Microsoft Word efficiently so you can spend less time doing assignments.

# Universal Shortcuts

Regardless of Mac, Apple, Linux, or even word. There are some shortcuts are going to be available to you:

```md

## Quick Save

It's important to save often, especially when you make large changes. To quick save, apply the following:

```md
| PC 🖥️          | Mac 🍎         |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Ctrl+S         | Cmd+S          |
| "Control Save" | "Command Save" |
```

## Printing

Equally important as saving is printing:

```md
| PC 🖥️           | Mac 🍎          |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Ctrl+P          | Cmd+P           |
| "Control Print" | "Command Print" |
```

## Spelling and Grammar

If you ever want a quick overview of all the spelling and grammar mistakes you are currently making, the `f7` key gives you a quick overview of all potential roasts.

```md
| PC 🖥️ | Mac 🍎 |
| :---- | :----- |
| f7    | f7     |
```

You should see the following open up:

## Finder

This opens up the "Navigation" panel to find a word in your document.

```md
| PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |

```

This is particularly useful when the document is large and you want to find all potential instances of a particular mistake, this is the FASTEST way you can find it:

# New Page

Sometimes you might find yourself making a bunch of enters so the text appears at the start of the next page. That's annoying. Instead run the following

```md
| PC 🖥️      | Mac 🍎    |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| Ctrl+Enter | Cmd+Enter |
```

And that's all you have to do :^)

## Opening & Creating Documents

There are different ways to open a new document or open an existing document

```md
|                       | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :-------------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Create a new document | Ctrl+N | Cmd+N  |
| Open an old document  | Ctrl+O | Cmd+O  |
```

## Text Formatting Shortcuts

Sometimes moving the cursor up to the Ribbon is annoying, the below are common text shortcuts are handy for quickly creating or editing text:

```md
| Style             | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |

| Italics           | Ctrl+I | Cmd+I  |
| Make font bigger  | Ctrl+] | Cmd+]  |

```

## Paragraph & Text Alignment

And equally important are the ways to modify the alignment of text on your page.

| Left      | Ctrl+L | Cmd+L  |
| Right     | Ctrl+R | Cmd+R  |

```

# More fun features

Let's start by making a blank document using `Ctrl+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+N` (Mac)

## Dictate

You don't actually need to type words into Microsoft Word. Use the above `Dictate` function for voice to text functionality:

![demo](./assets/1.png)

Have you ever been stuck on a lab assignment and didn't know where to start? Try this approach:

- Start by using the above function or vomiting all your thoughts and ideas on the page, no matter how scattered they might be.
- Once you’ve written down your stream of consciousness, use ChatGPT to summarize and organize your draft.
- After the AI has put together a more structured version, you can refine it to fit your own voice and style, rather than relying on the default tone provided by the bot.

AI is all around us now, but the key is to use it as a resource, not as a shortcut to complete your work. Fun Fact: This is actually how I write these notes and it’s a core part of my workflow.

However, remember that each class has its own policy on AI use. For this class, consider it a tool to support your work, not a replacement for the effort you put in (otherwise you will find my tests painful)

## Clear Formatting

Let's say you made a lot of different changes to the document and want to revert the styles back to the original state. You could hit "Undo" a whole bunch OR you could simply highlight the area of text you want to revert and click the "clear style" button:

## Dark Mode

Let's save your retinas and enable "Dark Mode" for Microsoft Word. First find the "Preferences" tab:

Now in the search bar, type "Dark" and the following should pop up once selected:

# Collaborative Tools

You do not necessarily need to access word through it's Desktop App. Open up your johnabbott [OneDrive](https://johnabbott-my.sharepoint.com/)

## Version History

Let's make some minor edits, however let's say I don't like the direction this document is going in, by selecting `File > Info > Version History` you can easily track and revert the changes.

## Comments and Suggestions

Users can highlight text where they want to add a comment, you should see a little 💬 icon appear. Click it and then use the @ symbol to directly annoy your peers with updates to your doc:
