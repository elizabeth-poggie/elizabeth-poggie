# Keyboard Shortcuts

Anything you can do with a mouse, you can do FASTER with a keyboard shortcut. In this class, we'll focus on learning how to use Microsoft Word efficiently so you can spend less time on assignments and more time on what matters to you.

# Universal Shortcuts

Whether you're using Mac, Windows, Linux, or even Word, there are certain shortcuts that will always be available to you.

```md
| Shortcut | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎      |
| :------- | :----- | :---------- |
| Copy 📑  | Ctrl+C | Cmd+C       |
| Cut 🪚   | Ctrl+X | Cmd+X       |
| Paste 🔩 | Ctrl+V | Cmd+V       |
| Undo ↩️  | Ctrl+Z | Cmd+Z       |
| Redo ↪️  | Ctrl+Y | Cmd+shift+Z |
```

# Microsoft Word Shortcuts

## Quick Save

It's important to save often, especially when making large changes. To quickly save your work, use the following shortcut:

```md
| PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :----- | :----- |
| Ctrl+S | Cmd+S  |
```

## Printing

Just as important as saving is knowing how to print your document efficiently:

```md
| PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :----- | :----- |
| Ctrl+P | Cmd+P  |
```

## Spelling and Grammar

If you want a quick summary of all your spelling and grammar mistakes, just hit the `F7` key. It will give you an instant overview of any potential roasts.

```md
| PC 🖥️ | Mac 🍎 |
| :---- | :----- |
| f7    | f7     |
```

Once clicked, you should see the following:

## Finder

The Finder tool opens the "Navigation" panel to quickly locate a word or phrase in your document.

```md
| PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :----- | :----- |
| Ctrl+F | Cmd+F  |
```

This shortcut is especially helpful when you're working with a large document and need to track down all instances of a specific error.

## New Page

Instead of hitting "Enter" repeatedly to push text to the next page, there's a quicker way to do it. Just use this shortcut:

```md
| PC 🖥️      | Mac 🍎    |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| Ctrl+Enter | Cmd+Enter |
```

And that's all you have to do :^)

## Opening & Creating Documents

There are a few simple ways to create a new document or open an existing one, making it easier to get started with your work.

```md
|                       | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :-------------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Create a new document | Ctrl+N | Cmd+N  |
| Open an old document  | Ctrl+O | Cmd+O  |
```

## Text Formatting Shortcuts

Sometimes moving the cursor up to the Ribbon is annoying. These common text formatting shortcuts make it easier to quickly create and edit your text:

```md
| Style             | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :---------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Underline         | Ctrl+U | Cmd+U  |
| Bold              | Ctrl+B | Cmd+B  |
| Italics           | Ctrl+I | Cmd+I  |
| Make font bigger  | Ctrl+] | Cmd+]  |
| Make font smaller | Ctrl+[ | Cmd+[  |
```

## Paragraph & Text Alignment

Equally important is adjusting the alignment of text on your page:

```md
| Alignment | PC 🖥️  | Mac 🍎 |
| :-------- | :----- | :----- |
| Center    | Ctrl+E | Cmd+E  |
| Left      | Ctrl+L | Cmd+L  |
| Right     | Ctrl+R | Cmd+R  |
| Justify   | Ctrl+J | Cmd+J  |
```

# More fun features

Let's start by making a blank document using `Ctrl+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+N` (Mac)

## Dictate

You don't actually need to type words into Microsoft Word. Use the above `Dictate` function for voice to text functionality:

![demo](./assets/1.png)

Have you ever been stuck on a lab assignment and didn't know where to start? Try this approach:

- Start by using the above function or vomiting all your thoughts and ideas on the page, no matter how scattered they might be.
- Once you’ve written down your stream of consciousness, use ChatGPT to summarize and organize your draft.
- After the AI has put together a more structured version, you can refine it to fit your own voice and style, rather than relying on the default tone provided by the bot.

AI is all around us now, but the key is to use it as a resource, not as a shortcut to complete your work. Fun Fact: This is actually how I write these notes and it’s a core part of my workflow.

However, remember that each class has its own policy on AI use. For this class, consider it a tool to support your work, not a replacement for the effort you put in (otherwise you will find my tests painful)

## Clear Formatting

Let's say you made a lot of different changes to the document and want to revert the styles back to the original state. You could hit "Undo" a whole bunch OR you could simply highlight the area of text you want to revert and click the "clear style" button:

![demo](./assets/4.png)

## Dark Mode

Let's save your retinas and enable "Dark Mode" for Microsoft Word. First find the "Preferences" tab:

![demo](./assets/9.png)

Now in the search bar, type "Dark" and the following should pop up once selected:

## Headers and Footers

To open up the `Header & Footer` tab, double click the top or bottom section of your document. This should then reveal the following:

![demo](./assets/15.png)

Now automatically enable the numbering of your pages in the area you prefer by Selecting `Page Number`:

![demo](./assets/16.png)

## Table of Contents

Inserting a Table of Contents (TOC) in Microsoft Word is a straightforward process that can be done automatically based on your document's heading styles.

Step 1: Before inserting the TOC, ensure that you’ve used Word’s built-in "Heading Styles" for your document headings.

![demo](./assets/11.png)

Step 2: if you don't like the default styles, open up the "Styles Pane", here you can either create new styles or modify existing ones.

![demo](./assets/12.png)

Step 3: Click where you want to insert the table of contents. Go to the `References > Table of Contents` and select from the dropdown which style you want.

![demo](./assets/13.png)

Step 4: As you continue working on the document and make changes to headings, you can update the TOC by clicking inside is and selecting "Update".

# Collaborative Tools

You do not necessarily need to access word through it's Desktop App. Open up your johnabbott [OneDrive](https://johnabbott-my.sharepoint.com/)

## Version History

Let's make some minor edits, however let's say I don't like the direction this document is going in, by selecting `File > Info > Version History` you can easily track and revert the changes.

![info](./assets/3.png)

## Comments and Suggestions

Users can highlight text where they want to add a comment, you should see a little 💬 icon appear. Click it and then use the @ symbol to directly annoy your peers with updates to your doc:

![comments](./assets/7.png)

## Real Time Co-Authoring

Multiple users can edit the document at the same time:

![users](./assets/10.png)

## Integration with Desktop Microsoft

Documents are automatically saved to OneDrive, making them accessible from anywhere. Try creating a document on the online tool, save it, and then open it using `Ctrl+O` (Windows) // `Cmd+O` (Mac) on the desktop tool.

# Exercise 1

For this exercise you are going to create a draft Lab Report that you would typically use in your other classes. To get started:

- Step 1) Open up a new doc using `Ctrl+O` (Windows) // `Cmd+O` (Mac)
- Step 2) Save this to your `OneDrive > Documents` folder. In here create a new subfolder called `Templates`.
- Step 3) Save your doc with a meaningful name that gives some context such as `Lab Report Template - JAC 2024`
- Step 4) Customize the document by adding any text, headings, images, formatting, or placeholders that you want to be part of the template. Try to include:
  - Headers & Footers
  - A TOC
  - An Into Page with your name and student ID
  - A table
- Step 5) Once completed, check to see how it looks on the online tool
- Step 6) After you create your template, I will show you how to export it soon.
