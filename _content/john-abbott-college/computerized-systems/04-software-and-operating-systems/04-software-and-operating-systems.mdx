# Recap

Hardware refers to any part the of the computer having a physical structure. Last class we discussed some computer parts, which ones were important?

## CPU

This is the "brain" of the computer. It executes instructions of a software program. The "power" of a CPU is determined by how many instructions it can execute per second, which is usually measure in `gigahertz (GHz)` (billions of instructions per second).

## RAM

This is the "short term memory" of the computer. The RAM (Random Access Memory), is used to temporarily hold information while the CPU is processing it.

## Storage Discs

This is the "long term memory" of the computer, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it. When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies some of the data from the storage disc onto the RAM. When you save a file, the data is copied back to the drive.

The storage space of a hard drive is measure in `gigabytes (GB)`, which is the same unit used to measure the RAM.

# Software

Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as "software". They fall into 2 general categories:

- Operating Systems (MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux)
- Application Software (Microsoft Word, Excel, Google Chrome)

# Operating Systems

An operating system is a set of programs that:

- Runs inside the hardware
- Communicates with and manages the hardware
- Hosts and runs application software, allowing application software to work with CPU Performs general housekeeping tasks for your computer: like system maintenance and file compression
- User Interface: how users interact with the computer (command line, menu, or Graphical User Interface -GUI)
- Can multitask

## Can you name a few operating systems?

- MacOS
- Windows
- iOS
- Android
- Linux
