# Test 1

Test 1 is scheduled for October 1 and will account for 20% of your overall grade. It will cover the material from Assignments 1 and 2, which will be released next week. This class does not rely on memorization, so the exercises you complete during class are you studying for the test.

TLDR: If you put in the work during these exercises, you will hopefully find the test easy.

# Quick Recap

- Headers & Footers with page numbers üëâ You can format the page numbers to match any specific style you prefer.
- Styles text and justification üëâ Using hotkeys will save you time when styling text and adjusting alignment.
- Default headings and the TOC üëâ You can customize the default heading styles by using the "Styles" pane.
- Templates üëâ Microsoft Office templates may take some time to load because it's Microsoft. If you experienced any issues with a template from the last class (like me lol), it should open properly now.

# Footnotes and Endnotes

Sometimes, you may need to add important details that are not part of the main content of your document.

## Where do they appear?

- _Footnotes_ are located at the bottom of the page.
- _Endnotes_ are placed at the end of the entire document.

## How do they relate to the text?

Footnotes and endnotes use a number or symbol that corresponds to a reference mark in the main text.

## How do you add them?

First, select the text where you want to place the reference for a footnote or endnote. Next, go to the "References" tab and click "Insert Footnote" or "Insert Endnote":

This will open the area where you can add text:

To return to your spot in the document, double-click outside the view.

## What should you do if you get stuck?

If you run into any issues, refer to the official Microsoft documentation on footnotes & endnotes [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-footnotes-and-endnotes-61f3fb1a-4717-414c-9a8f-015a5f3ff4cb).

# Citations vs Bibliography vs References

These are not the same.

## What's the difference?

- In _Citations_, you only list items you have referred to AND cited in your paper.
- A _Bibliography_ is a list of all the sources you used to generate your ideas about the topic including those cited in your paper as well as those you did not cite.
- In _References_, you only list sources that you have cited IN TEXT in your paper.
