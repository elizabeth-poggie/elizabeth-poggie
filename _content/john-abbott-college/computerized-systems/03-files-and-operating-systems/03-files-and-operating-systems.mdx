# Computer Systems

Building on what we learnt last class, a lot of things could be considered a computer that works exclusively with 1s and 0s. So how do we get from that to what we know, love, and use every day?

In this class we will look at how we go from simple 1s and 0s to transistors, to hardware all the way up to operating systems and application software.

# Hardware and Software

Computers are designed to do any job that their operating systems and application software tell them to do. But how exactly do they manage this, and why?

Computers operate through a combination of hardware and software.

# What is Hardware?

Hardware provides the physical components, like:

- The CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Input devices
- Output devices
- ... and more

which are necessary for processing data. Expanding on our earlier emoji diagram:

input      CPU     output
```

## What are Input Devices?

Input devices are components of a computer system, allowing users to interact with the computer by providing data and commands. These devices gather "input" in various forms and send it to the CPU for processing:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Scanner
- Microphone
- Camera

Input devices act as a bridge between the physical world and the digital environment, enabling computers to understand and respond to human actions or other external signals.

## What is the CPU?

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It's the primary component responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from input devices and other system areas that we’ll explore soon. Just as our senses (like eyes, hands, and nose) send information to our brain for processing, input devices send information to the CPU.

In the same way that our eyes, hands and nose take in information to send to the brain, input devices take in information to send to the CPU for processing.

```text

⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

Every action a computer performs—from running applications to processing data—relies on the CPU’s ability to execute instructions. If the CPU stopped working, the entire system would shut down, much like how our bodies would cease to function if the brain stopped working.

```text

             🥔
👀🤲👃   ↔️   🧠

The end of your computer as you know it:
             🔥
⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

However, if an input device, like a mouse, fails, the CPU can continue to function perfectly fine. You can still interact with the system using other devices, such as a keyboard or track pad. Similarly, if your eyes require glasses, your brain can still process visual information correctly with the aid of glasses.

```

So, while the CPU is essential, input devices are equally important for providing the information that the CPU needs to keep everything running smoothly. Remember those transistors we discussed yesterday? They are the building blocks of the CPU, acting as tiny switches that control the flow of electrical signals. Unlike our neurons, which send complex electrical signals requiring years of study to fully understand, transistors operate on a simpler system of "on" and "off" states, corresponding to the binary code (1s and 0s) that computers use to perform calculations and execute instructions.

## What are Output Devices?

Output devices are the components of a computer system that take processed data from the CPU and present it in a form that humans can understand or use. These devices translate the computer's digital signals (1s and 0s) into physical output. Common examples include:

- Monitors
- Printers
- Speakers
- Projectors
- Headphones

Output devices are important for making the work of the CPU make sense to us. They bridge the gap between the computer’s digital processes and the physical world, allowing us to interact with and experience the results of computing tasks.

```text

```

Without output devices, we'd be left with raw 1s and 0s that would make 0 sense to us, much like how studying brain signals can be confusing to the average person. Even neuroscientists, with their advanced knowledge, must interpret complex patterns to draw meaningful conclusions.

```

Just as understanding brain signals requires a PHD in neuroscience, understanding the full workings of binary and CPU processes is way beyond the scope of a single lecture, and even of an undergraduate computer science course.

Computers are complicated, just like with people, and mastering even a single component can lead to an entire field of study.

# How do computers store information?

Computers only think in terms of 1s and 0s (binary). Every bit of information on your computer is coded in binary and the your computer will translate one set of of 1s and 0s to another when displaying information on your screen.

## What is a file?

On a computer, you probably have pictures, word documents, saved video games, applications, code, plus a whole lot more. It would be very difficult if every time you opened Word, every document that you ever wrote was all smushed together.

```text
literally everything on your computer    ↔️    🔍😭
```

So, to make your life easier, your computer organizes data into discrete elements, called files. Each file has the data for one thing only, for example, one picture, one Word Document, one application, etc.

```text
📁       📁         📁          ↔️    🔍👀
⬆       ⬆          ⬆
image    word doc    excel
```

In the old days, files used to be a document that was printed on paper. Today, most people refer to files as a document of some kind (picture, code, Word, etc) that is stored on your computer.

```text

🗃️

files for zoomers:
📁

files for gen alpha:
📱
```

As we progress in society, the way information gets further abstracted away from how we store information on a computer.

## How are files organized?

Before computers were everywhere, most people and companies organized their files into folders.

```text
📁
```

Each folder would have a name, describing what types of files it contained (example: ‘Project 1‘, ‘Project 2‘)

```text
📁           📁
⬆           ⬆
project 1    project 2
```

Maybe, if the number of files were large, the owner of a company might reorganize their files, so that the folder ‘Project 1‘ might be contain more folders (example: grades, lectures, etc.)

```text
    project 1
      📁
      ⬆
📁          📁
⬆          ⬆
grades      lectures
```

With the advent of computers, we went from storing files on paper, in paper folders, in filing cabinets, to storing files on computers easier, the people in charge decided to use the same names.

So, in a folder you can have files and other folders. Since folders are not longer physical things, we need a way to envision them. In short, folders (or directories) are organized into a tree format:

```md
documents
├── english
│ ├── Assignment 1.docx
│ ├── Assignment 2.docx
├── computerized-systems
│ ├── Assignment 1
│ │ ├── raw-info.xls
│ │ ├── summary.pdf
│ ├── Assignment 2
│ │ ├── raw-info.xls
│ │ ├── instructions.pdf
```

# What is Software?

The software, on the other hand, provides the instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

The operating system acts as the middleman, managing the communication between the hardware and the application software.

When you run a program, the operating system interprets the software's instructions, sending them to the CPU to be processed. The CPU then executes these instructions, performing calculations, moving data, and interacting with other hardware components as needed.
