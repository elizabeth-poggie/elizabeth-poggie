# Computer Systems

Building on what we learnt last class, a lot of things could be considered a computer that works exclusively with 1s and 0s. So how do we get from that to what we know, love, and use every day?

In this week we will look at how we go from simple 1s and 0s to transistors, to hardware all the way up to operating systems and application software.

# Hardware and Software

Computers are designed to do any job that their operating systems and application software tell them to do. But how exactly do they manage this, and why?

Computers operate through a combination of hardware and software.

# What is Hardware?

Hardware provides the physical components, like:

- The CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Input devices
- Output devices
- ... and more

which are necessary for processing data. Expanding on our earlier emoji diagram:

```text
this is all "hardware"

            ↕
⌨️ 📷🖱️  ↔️  💾  ↔️  📠 🖥️ 🔊
input      CPU     output
```

## What are Input Devices?

Input devices are components of a computer system, allowing users to interact with the computer by providing data and commands. These devices gather "input" in various forms and send it to the CPU for processing:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Scanner
- Microphone
- Camera

Input devices act as a bridge between the physical world and the digital environment, enabling computers to understand and respond to human actions or other external signals.

```text

```

## What is the CPU?

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It's the primary component responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from input devices and other system areas that we’ll explore soon. Just as our senses (like eyes, hands, and nose) send information to our brain for processing, input devices send information to the CPU.

In the same way that our eyes, hands and nose take in information to send to the brain, input devices take in information to send to the CPU for processing.

```text
👀🤲👃   ↔️   🧠

⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

Every action a computer performs—from running applications to processing data—relies on the CPU’s ability to execute instructions. If the CPU stopped working, the entire system would shut down, much like how our bodies would cease to function if the brain stopped working.

```text
The end of Poggie as we know her:
             🥔
👀🤲👃   ↔️   🧠

The end of your computer as you know it:
             🔥
⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

However, if an input device, like a mouse, fails, the CPU can continue to function perfectly fine. You can still interact with the system using other devices, such as a keyboard or track pad. Similarly, if your eyes require glasses, your brain can still process visual information correctly with the aid of glasses.

```text

👓
👀   ↔️   🧠

No mouse for you:
🔥
🖱️ ⌨️   ↔️   💾
```

So, while the CPU is essential, input devices are equally important for providing the information that the CPU needs to keep everything running smoothly. Remember those transistors we discussed yesterday? They are the building blocks of the CPU, acting as tiny switches that control the flow of electrical signals. Unlike our neurons, which send complex electrical signals requiring years of study to fully understand, transistors operate on a simpler system of "on" and "off" states, corresponding to the binary code (1s and 0s) that computers use to perform calculations and execute instructions.

## What are Output Devices?

Output devices are the components of a computer system that take processed data from the CPU and present it in a form that humans can understand or use. These devices translate the computer's digital signals (1s and 0s) into physical output. Common examples include:

- Monitors
- Printers
- Speakers
- Projectors
- Headphones

Output devices are important for making the work of the CPU make sense to us. They bridge the gap between the computer’s digital processes and the physical world, allowing us to interact with and experience the results of computing tasks.

```text
📠 🖥️ 🔊       ↔️      🧑

```

Without output devices, we'd be left with raw 1s and 0s that would make 0 sense to us, much like how studying brain signals can be confusing to the average person. Even neuroscientists, with their advanced knowledge, must interpret complex patterns to draw meaningful conclusions.

```text

🦠🦠🦠      ↔️       🔍🧑

You observing transistors and being confused:
⎇⎇⎇       ↔️       🔍🧑
```

Just as understanding brain signals requires a PHD in neuroscience, understanding the full workings of binary and CPU processes is way beyond the scope of a single lecture, and even of an undergraduate computer science course.

Computers are complicated, just like with people, and mastering even a single component can lead to an entire field of study.

# How do computers store information?

Computers operate using a binary system, where every piece of data is represented by a series of 1s and 0s. Your computer encodes and decodes this binary data to display information on your screen.

## What is a file?

On a computer, files can include a variety of content such as pictures, documents, video games, applications, and code. Imagine if every time you opened Word, all your documents were jumbled together:

```text
literally everything on your computer    ↔️    🔍😭
```

To keep things organized, your computer uses files to separate data into distinct elements. Each file contains specific data, like one picture, one document, or one application.

```text
📁       📁         📁          ↔️    🔍👀
⬆       ⬆          ⬆
image    word doc    excel
```

In the past, "files" referred to physical documents stored in folders. Today, files are digital documents stored on your computer.

```text
files for boomers:
🗃️

files for zoomers:
📁

files for gen alpha:
📱
```

As technology evolves, the way we interact with files continues to become more abstract.

## How are files organized?

Before computers became widespread, people and companies organized their physical files into folders.

```text
file           folder
📁       ➡       🗂️
```

Each folder had a name describing its contents, such as 'Project 1' or 'Project 2'.

```text
🗂️          🗂️
⬆           ⬆
project 1    project 2
```

For larger collections of files, folders could contain subfolders. For example, 'Project 1' might include additional folders like 'grades' and 'lectures'.

```text
    project 1
      🗂️
      ⬆
🗂️          🗂️
⬆          ⬆
grades      lectures
```

And inside these sub folders we would have actual files:

```text
    project 1
      🗂️
      ⬆
🗂️          🗂️
⬆          ⬆
📁📁📁      📁📁📁
⬆          ⬆
excel       pdf
```

With computers, we moved from physical folders to digital ones, but the concept remained similar. Folders, or directories, are organized in a tree-like structure:

```md
documents
├── english
│ ├── Assignment 1.docx
│ ├── Assignment 2.docx
├── computerized-systems
│ ├── Assignment 1
│ │ ├── raw-info.xls
│ │ ├── summary.pdf
│ ├── Assignment 2
│ │ ├── raw-info.xls
│ │ ├── instructions.pdf
```

## What does this look like on our computers?

Welcome to `File Explorer`, where you'll navigate through your files during this course.

![file_explorer](./assets/file_explorer.png)

In the image above, the top line shows the folder hierarchy:

```text
Sandy > Science-CompSci > QuestionPool > ReadCSV > Solution_01
```

This means the folder 'Sandy' contains 'Science-CompSci', which contains...

```md
Sandy
├── Science-CompSci
│ ├── QuestionPool
│ │ ├── ReadCSV
│ │ │ ├── Solution_01
```

The list of files in the main window represents the contents of the `'Solution_01'` folder in a tree like hierarchy.

# What is a file extensions?

A file extension is the last part of a file name, following the final dot (.), indicating the file type. For example, `code.py` has a file extension` .py`, and a Word document typically has the extension `.docx`.

## Why don’t I see them in File Explorer?

By default, File Explorer hides file extensions to simplify the user interface. However, as a programmer, it's crucial to know file extensions.

To view file extensions:

- Open `File Explorer`, go to "View," and select "Details."
- Check the "File name extensions" box.

Seeing file extensions helps you understand what type of file you’re working with.

## Why do we use File Extensions?

File extensions signal the operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac) about the file type. For example, a `.png` extension indicates an image file. Double-clicking such a file opens it with the appropriate program. Similarly, a `.docx` file opens with Microsoft Word.

Important Extensions in this course:

- Images: `.png` `.jpeg` `.gif`
- Documents: `.docx` `.txt` `.html`
- Audio: `.mp3` `.flac`
- Compressed files: `.zip`

# Compressing / Uncompressing files

There are multiple ways to create a single file from a set of other files (LEA only accepts one document). We will only be discussing one method in this document.

## Compressing Files

- Open file explorer.
- To `zip`, select the files that you want to zip together, and right-click. Select `send to` then `compressed folder`

A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location. To rename it, right-click the folder and select `Rename` and then type the new name

## Extracting Files

- Locate the `zip`ped folder that you want to `unzip` (extract)
- Do one of the following:
  - to unzip a single file or folder, open the zipped folder then drag the file or folder to the new location. This way works but is deeply inefficient.
  - To unzip all the con6tents of the zipped folder at once, right click the folder and select `Extract All`

## Misleading Information

If you have double-clicked on a `zip` file, it will open a new window showing all the files within the zip file. This can be misleading because it looks just the same as if the files have been unzipped. However the contents of the zipped file are "READ ONLY". You will not be able to modify the contents unless you first `Extract` them.

TLDR: ALWAYS extract the compressed file before working on it.

# Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will create a compressed folder:

- Create a folder named `practice-2`
- Inside this folder, create subfolders for each type
  - Images
  - Documents
- Save several images of your favorite animal in the `practice-2 > Images` directory.
  - Take a screenshot showing the file extensions of your images. Are they `png`, `jpg`, or a `gif`?
  - Drag and drop your screenshot into the `practice-2 > Images` directory.
- Open Excel and create an empty file:
  - Save this file under `practice-2 > Documents`
- Compress your `practice-2` folder.
- Rename the folder to your student ID and upload it to LEA.

# Computer Storage

Now that we understand how to interact with an output device like a monitor, which displays storage information in a way that makes sense to us, let’s explore what happens behind the scenes. While we deal with files and folders that make sense to our brains, the CPU, or the computer's brain, operates on data in a way that is specific to the computer.

## RAM

Much like the memory in the human brain, computer memory stores data. There are two types of computer memory: short-term (temporary) and long-term (permanent).

```text
Processor        Temporary           Permanent
                  Storage             Storage


🧠          ↔️   i am hungry.      The good ol' days

💾          ↔️        🫙                  💿
```

The `RAM` (Random Access Memory), is used to temporarily hold information while the CPU is processing it. Think of this as the computer’s work area, it works similarly to your "short term" memory. Do you need to know that on September 3rd, 2024 at 12:00pm that you were craving poutine? Absolutely not. This information is "temporary" similar to how "temporary" information is in RAM.

```text
🧠          ↔️   i am hungry.      The good ol' days

💾          ↔️        🫙                  💿
                     ⬆
                     RAM
```

The CPU doesn’t access information directly from the hard drive because it's too slow for the CPU's needs. Instead, data and instructions are temporarily loaded into RAM for quick access.

```text
🧠          ↔️     i am hungry.    ↔️   In the good ol' days i ate poutine
                      ⬆                           ⬆
                  short term                   long term


💾          ↔️        🫙        ↔️         💿
                     ⬆                   ⬆
                     RAM              long term
```

More RAM means more programs can run simultaneously, which is why gamers and power users often seek out high amounts of RAM. They need ample "short-term memory" to run complex simulations smoothly. Going back to our analogy, the more "short-term memory" we have, the more food options we can keep in our brain at a given single instant.

However, once the computer is turned off, all information in RAM is erased. So, how does the computer retain information after being powered off?

## Storage Discs

The Storage Disc or Storage Drive, is where your software, documents, movies, and other files are stored. The Storage Drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.

When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies some of the data from the storage disc onto the RAM. When you save a file, the data is copied back to the drive.

A Hard Drive is an older type of storage drives that uses a spinning disc (like a spinning vinyl) to store information. Modern drives use a technology called SSD or Solid State Drives, which has no moving parts and are much faster than spinning discs. SSD's allow your computer to start up and load programs faster.

Some examples of external storage are:

- USB Keys
- SD Cards
- DVDs
- CDs
- and even vinyls can be considered an external storage.

# Exercise 2

To find out how much resources we have, let's look at the specifications for our computers:

- Open the File Explorer
- Right click the "This PC" icon
- Select "Properties"
- What processor type and how much RAM do you have?

To find the amount of Long term storage you have:

- Open the File Explorer
- Right click on the "Local Disk (C:)" icon
- Select "Properties"
- What is the capacity of your Disk?
