# Intro to Operating Systems

Building on what we learnt last class, a lot of things could be considered a computer that works exclusively with 1s and 0s. So how do we get from that to what we know, love, and use every day?

In this class we will look at how we go from simple 1s and 0s to transistors, to hardware all the way up to operating systems and application software.

# Hardware and Software

Computers are designed to do any job that their operating systems and application software tell them to do. But how exactly do they manage this, and why?

Computers operate through a combination of hardware and software.

## What is Hardware?

Hardware provides the physical components, like:

- The CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Input devices
- Output devices
- ... and more

which are necessary for processing data. Expanding on our earlier emoji diagram:

```

## What are Input Devices?

Input devices are essential components of a computer system, allowing users to interact with the computer by providing data and commands. These devices take "input" in various forms:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Scanner
- Microphone
- Camera

After taking "input", they send this information to the CPU for processing. Input devices bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital environment, enabling computers to understand and respond to human actions or other external signals.

## What is the CPU?

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is the primary component responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the "input devices", as well as other areas of the system that we will explore soon.

In the same way that our eyes, hands and nose take in information to send to the brain, input devices take in information to send to the CPU for processing.

Every action a computer performs—from running applications to processing data—depends on the CPU's ability to carry out instructions. In the same way that if I got into a car accident and became a vegetable tomorrow, if the CPU stopped working, so would our entire system.

The end of your computer as you know it:
             🔥
⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

However, let's say we had a faulty input device, like a mouse, well the CPU could go on performing fine because we can still use our keyboard or track pad to interact with the system. In the same way that I have to wear glasses to aid my "visual stimuli" input put device (e.g. eyeballs), my brain can still interpret whats going on fine.

## What is Software?

The software, on the other hand, provides the instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

The operating system acts as the middleman, managing the communication between the hardware and the application software.

When you run a program, the operating system interprets the software's instructions, sending them to the CPU to be processed. The CPU then executes these instructions, performing calculations, moving data, and interacting with other hardware components as needed.
