# Intro to Operating Systems

Building on what we learnt last class, a lot of things could be considered a computer that works exclusively with 1s and 0s. So how do we get from that to what we know, love, and use every day?

In this class we will look at how we go from simple 1s and 0s to transistors, to hardware all the way up to operating systems and application software.

# Hardware and Software

Computers are designed to do any job that their operating systems and application software tell them to do. But how exactly do they manage this, and why?

Computers operate through a combination of hardware and software.

# What is Hardware?

Hardware provides the physical components, like:

- The CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Input devices
- Output devices
- ... and more

which are necessary for processing data. Expanding on our earlier emoji diagram:

```

## What are Input Devices?

Input devices are components of a computer system, allowing users to interact with the computer by providing data and commands. These devices gather "input" in various forms and send it to the CPU for processing:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Scanner
- Microphone
- Camera

Input devices act as a bridge between the physical world and the digital environment, enabling computers to understand and respond to human actions or other external signals.

## What is the CPU?

The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It's the primary component responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from input devices and other system areas that we’ll explore soon. Just as our senses (like eyes, hands, and nose) send information to our brain for processing, input devices send information to the CPU.

In the same way that our eyes, hands and nose take in information to send to the brain, input devices take in information to send to the CPU for processing.

Every action a computer performs—from running applications to processing data—relies on the CPU’s ability to execute instructions. If the CPU stopped working, the entire system would shut down, much like how our bodies would cease to function if the brain stopped working.

The end of your computer as you know it:

⌨️ 📷🖱️   ↔️   💾
```

However, if an input device, like a mouse, fails, the CPU can continue to function perfectly fine. You can still interact with the system using other devices, such as a keyboard or track pad. Similarly, if your eyes require glasses, your brain can still process visual information correctly with the aid of glasses.

So, while the CPU is essential, input devices are equally important for providing the information that the CPU needs to keep everything running smoothly. Remember our transistors from yesterday? These are fundamental components that make up the CPU. They act as tiny switches that can turn on or off to control the flow of electrical signals. While our neurons send electrical signals that are so nuanced that it takes a PHD to begin to apply any knowledge in the field of neuroscience, transistors simply rely on "on" and "off" states that correspond to the binary code (1s and 0s) that computers use to perform calculations and execute instructions.

## What are Output Devices?

Output devices are the components of a computer system that take processed data from the CPU and present it in a form that humans can understand or use. These devices translate the computer's digital signals (1s and 0s) into physical output. Common examples of output devices include:

- Monitors
- Printers
- Speakers
- Projectors
- Headphones
- and so much more

Output devices are essential for making the work of the CPU make sense to us. They bridge the gap between the computer’s digital processes and the physical world, allowing us to interact with and experience the results of computing tasks.

```

Going back to our 1s and 0s, without output devices, we would get raw 1s and 0s that make 0 sense to us. Much like if we studied the signals of the brain, it would make no sense to the average person. Even to people with a phd in neuroscience, drawing conclusions exclusively from patterns of brain signals understandably results in a PHD.

```

And just like how you need to level up in the neuroscience field to begin to understand cell signal processes, understanding pure binary and the way CPUs work is outside the scope of this lecture and even outside the scope of an undergrad in computer science.

Computers are complicated, just like with people, and understanding even one component is an entire field of study.

# What is Software?

The software, on the other hand, provides the instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

The operating system acts as the middleman, managing the communication between the hardware and the application software.

When you run a program, the operating system interprets the software's instructions, sending them to the CPU to be processed. The CPU then executes these instructions, performing calculations, moving data, and interacting with other hardware components as needed.
