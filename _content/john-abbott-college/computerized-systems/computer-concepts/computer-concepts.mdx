# Why care?

To excel in a career in Biopharmaceutical Production Technology, you need to develop a solid understanding of several key computer concepts and skills. The truth is, many of you will be working with computers just as much as you will be working with people. Mastering the concepts covered in this class will not only help you succeed at JAC but will also give you a solid foundation for success in the industry.

## Industry Standards and Compliance

The biopharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, with strict guidelines for data management, process control, and product quality. Data integrity is a top priority, as any issues can lead to potential legal problems. We always strive to minimize lawsuit potential in our work, as nothing jeopardizes job security faster than legal complications :^). Consequently, understanding how to use software that ensures compliance with regulations like those set by the FDA will set you up for success in the field.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

As personalized medicine becomes increasingly important, data analysis tools are essential for understanding complex biological data. When it comes to efficiently managing large amounts of sensitive data and minimizing human error, strong computer literacy is an asset.

## Collaboration and Communication

In the biopharmaceutical industry, teams are often multidisciplinary and spread across different cities, and sometimes even continents. Effective communication and collaboration tools are crucial to ensure projects are completed on time and that everyone stays aligned. Proficiency in using software like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace will be expected when you enter the field, so it's important to be comfortable with these tools.

# What's skills matter?

There are many skills needed to excel in this field. For the purposes of this class, we'll focus on the following:

## Basic Computer Concepts

Building skills in organizing, accessing, and managing digital files efficiently.

## Operating Systems

Understanding how to use different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Spreadsheet Software

Developing proficiency in using spreadsheets for analyzing biological data.

## Word Processing Software

Becoming proficient with word processing and presentation tools such as Microsoft Office and Google Workspace.

## Database Software

Learning how to use and manage databases, including the ability to store and retrieve biopharmaceutical data.

## ... and more

While this class will focus on these areas, keep in mind that concepts like automation, laboratory information management systems, security, and basic programming will also be valuable in your career. However, these are beyond the scope of what we'll cover here.

# Computer Essentials

Computers are the life blood of today's world. If they were to suddenly turn off, all at once, the power grid would shut down, cars would crash, and planes would fall, water treatment plants would stop, the stock market would freeze, and employees wouldn't get paid.

Computers have not just changed the biopharmaceutical industry, but almost all of our lives.

## What are computers?

They are just simple machines that perform complex actions through many layers opf abstraction. In the next few lectures we are going to break down those layers and build up from simple 1s and 0s to operating systems, the entire internet and beyond.

But before we get into the context of the computers we know and love today, we first need to understand the context behind them to better appreciate why there are so many different layers to begin with.

So let's start at the beginning...

# The People and the Inventions

## What's the earliest recognized device for computing?

The abacus, invented in Mesopotamia around 2500 BCE, is often recognized as the earliest computing device. Essentially, it is a hand-operated calculator. But why is it considered a computer? Despite being manually operated and lacking electronic components or software, the abacus performs calculations and processes data in a way that reflects the basic functions of modern computers. It embodies the fundamental principles of computation, serving as a precursor to today’s computing devices.

## What was the first use of the term computer?

Originally, the term "computer" referred to a person who performed calculations, often with the aid of machines. This role continued into the late 1800s, when the meaning of "computer" shifted from describing an occupation to referring to the machines we use today.

"As each increase of knowledge, as well on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes abridged." - Charles Babbage, the pioneer of computing

Or, in other words, "Why work if a machine can do it for you?"

## Why did we need to create faster computers?

Speed and accuracy are especially important on the battlefield which is why the military was the first to apply computing to complex problems. What sort of problems you may ask? Well, how to effectively fire your cannons at your enemies despite weather conditions. The weather unfortunately can affect how accurately you can plow down the opposing parties so there was a larger need for faster computing devices.

Somewhat ironically, the first "computer device" that was created was with the intent to destroy people as opposed to it's more altruistic intents in modern society.

## What is the first general purpose computer?

Charles Babbage spent over two decades working on the creation of a massive 15-ton computer. As you might imagine, the project was eventually discontinued due to its massive cost, which far outweighed its practical applications at the time. Despite this, Babbage's work represents the first attempt to design a general-purpose computation device. For this reason, he is still celebrated as the father of computing, even though his project was well ahead of its time.

## What is the Analytical Engine?

The pros:

- Capable of performing various computations, not limited to a single task
- Could be given data and run operations in sequence
- Featured memory and a primitive printer
- Implemented conditional branches and looping, concepts that all the computer nerds continue to love to this day.

The cons:

- Never fully constructed due to being ahead of its time
- Being "easily transportable" was not a top priority during its design

In summary: The ability to automate a series of operations was groundbreaking and foreshadowed the development of modern computer programs

# The First Programmer

The Analytical Engine would inspire, arguably, the first generation of computer scientists. It was not long after it's proposition that Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, wrote hypothetical programs that could be run on the machine.

She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and went on to publish the first ever algorithm intended to be carried out by the Analytical Engine.

Consequently, she is considered the world's first programmer. Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine demonstrated a deep understanding of the machine’s potential, including concepts like looping and conditional branching, which are fundamental to modern programming.

# Electronic Computing

## Early Electromechanical Computing

One of the largest electromechanical computers built between 1937 and 1944 was the Harvard Mark 1. Why? For the allies in World War I. The early uses for this machine was running simulations for the manhattan project. However these machines were massive, dark, and prone to error. These machines attracted bugs and from then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it. What started as a literal moth in the machine, eventually became a euphuism to describe unexpected behavior in computer programs today.

## Colossus

Mechanical computers were far from perfect and therefore the need for purely electrical computers became necessary. When working with time sensitive information, you couldn't afford to have faulty calculations generated by literal moths. This is why the Colossus Mark 1 was considered ground breaking.

Why was this developed? Military purposes of course and this time the intent was to decode nazi communication in World War II. In 1943 developed by Tommy Flowers, 12 of these machines were built. This is considered the first programmable electronic computer and it's existence was shrouded in secrecy until the mid-1970s because the last thing the allies wanted was for their enemies to have access to the sort of innovative tools they had.

It was still a very complicated setup so while it is considered "programmable", it still had to be configured to perform any specific operation.

## ENIAC

That's why a few years later the Electronic Numerical Integrator and computer, or ENIAC for short, was created to address these concerns. Designed by John Mauchly and Presper Eckert, this was the worlds first computer that was :

- General purpose
- Fully Programmable
- Fully Electronic

It could perform calculations within seconds, faster than any "computer" that came before it. It was operational for ten years, and is estimated to have done more arithmetic than the entire human race up to that point.

## Why was ENIAC made?

A common theme you might be picking up on is that it was designed for miliary purposes. Originally used to calculate artillery trajectories and ballistic tables for the Army. These calculations were essential for optimizing the accuracy of artillery fire and required extensive computational power. Big shout out to Charles Babbage because the machine he was trying to make about a century earlier, finally came into creation now that we had access to the materials necessary to actualize his original idea.

## Why do you think we needed to move away from ENIAC?

The way that the "electronics" was done back then was with vacume tubes. Think of them as like primitive light bulbs and like the lights in your home, there was a lot of burn out associated with them making failures common. But because the rate at which these guys were doing math, the machine was only operational for half a day before falling apart again.

Again innovation was necessary. To reduce cost and size, as well as increase the speed of computation, a new invention came into creation. Thanks to John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter Brattain we do not have computers that are 8 feet tall, 100 feet long, and over 30 tons like our friend the ENIAC.

## Transistors

Unlike fragile vacume tubes made with glass, transistors were solid materials. This led to smaller and cheeper computers that could perform operations more efficiently and without failure. While ENIAC could at best be kept operational for half a day, this innovation was consistently operational.

Thanks to transistors, IBM pivoted all their computer machines to a transistor based architecture which made com putting power accessible to the general public instead of a reserved privilege for military personal. Today, computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometers in size. To give you perspective, a sheet of paper is roughly 100 000 nanometers thick, so if you lined up 2000 transistors in a stack you would be at the same thickness of that paper.

But how do we get from transistors to actually computing something? Let's get into it.
