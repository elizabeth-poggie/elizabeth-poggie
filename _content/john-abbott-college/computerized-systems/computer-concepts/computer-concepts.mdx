# Why care?

To excel in a career in Biopharmaceutical Production Technology, you need to develop a solid understanding of several key computer concepts and skills. The reality is that many of you are actually going to be working with computers as much as you will be working with people, so mastery of the concepts covered in this class will not only set you up for success at JAC but in industry as well.

## Industry Standards and Compliance

The biopharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, with strict guidelines for data management, process control, and product quality. Data Integrity is a top priority and any corruption opens up the door to potential legal issues. We always strive to minimize lawsuit potential in our work, as nothing jeopardizes job security faster than legal complications :^). Therefore, understanding how to use software that ensures compliance with regulations like the FDA will set you up for success.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

With the growing importance of personalized medicine, data analysis tools help in understanding complex biological data, optimizing production processes, and ensuring product quality. When it comes to managing large amounts of sensitive data efficiently and you want to reduce the amount of human error associated with these computations, computer literacy is an asset.

## Collaboration and Communication

The biopharmaceutical industry involves multidisciplinary teams, often spread across different cities and even continents. Effective communication and collaboration tools are necessary to ensure that projects are completed on time and that all team members are on the same page. Using software effectively like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace will be an assumption upon entering the field.

# What's skills matter?

There are many skills that matter to excel in the field. For the purposes of this class, these include:

## Basic Computer Concepts

Developing skills in organizing, accessing, and managing digital files efficiently.

## Operating Systems

Understanding different operating systems and how to use them like Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Spreadsheet Software

Proficiency with spreadsheets for analyzing biological data.

## Word Processing Software

Proficiency with word processing and presentation tools like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace.

## Database Software

Knowledge of how to use and manage databases, as well as storing and retrieving biopharmaceutical data.

# ... and more

Concepts like automation, laboratory Information management systems, security, and basic programming will also prove useful in your careers however that is outside the scope of this class.
