# Why care?

To excel in a career in Biopharmaceutical Production Technology, you need to develop a solid understanding of several key computer concepts and skills. The truth is, many of you will be working with computers just as much as you will be working with people. Mastering the concepts covered in this class will not only help you succeed at JAC but will also give you a solid foundation for success in the industry.

## Industry Standards and Compliance

The biopharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, with strict guidelines for data management, process control, and product quality. Data integrity is a top priority, as any issues can lead to potential legal problems. We always strive to minimize lawsuit potential in our work, as nothing jeopardizes job security faster than legal complications :^). Consequently, understanding how to use software that ensures compliance with regulations like those set by the FDA will set you up for success in the field.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

As personalized medicine becomes increasingly important, data analysis tools are essential for understanding complex biological data. When it comes to efficiently managing large amounts of sensitive data and minimizing human error, strong computer literacy is an asset.

## Collaboration and Communication

In the biopharmaceutical industry, teams are often multidisciplinary and spread across different cities, and sometimes even continents. Effective communication and collaboration tools are crucial to ensure projects are completed on time and that everyone stays aligned. Proficiency in using software like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace will be expected when you enter the field, so it's important to be comfortable with these tools.

# What's skills matter?

There are many skills needed to excel in this field. For the purposes of this class, we'll focus on the following:

## Basic Computer Concepts

Building skills in organizing, accessing, and managing digital files efficiently.

## Operating Systems

Understanding how to use different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Spreadsheet Software

Developing proficiency in using spreadsheets for analyzing biological data.

## Word Processing Software

Becoming proficient with word processing and presentation tools such as Microsoft Office and Google Workspace.

## Database Software

Learning how to use and manage databases, including the ability to store and retrieve biopharmaceutical data.

# ... and more

While this class will focus on these areas, keep in mind that concepts like automation, laboratory information management systems, security, and basic programming will also be valuable in your career. However, these are beyond the scope of what we'll cover here.
