# Why care?

To excel in a career in Biopharmaceutical Production Technology, you need to develop a solid understanding of several key computer concepts and skills. The truth is, many of you will be working with computers just as much as you will be working with people. Mastering the concepts covered in this class will not only help you succeed at JAC but will also give you a solid foundation for success in the industry.

## Industry Standards and Compliance

The biopharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, with strict guidelines for data management, process control, and product quality. Data integrity is a top priority, as any issues can lead to potential legal problems. We always strive to minimize lawsuit potential in our work, as nothing jeopardizes job security faster than legal complications :^). Consequently, understanding how to use software that ensures compliance with regulations like those set by the FDA will set you up for success in the field.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

As personalized medicine becomes increasingly important, data analysis tools are essential for understanding complex biological data. When it comes to efficiently managing large amounts of sensitive data and minimizing human error, strong computer literacy is an asset.

## Collaboration and Communication

In the biopharmaceutical industry, teams are often multidisciplinary and spread across different cities, and sometimes even continents. Effective communication and collaboration tools are crucial to ensure projects are completed on time and that everyone stays aligned. Proficiency in using software like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace will be expected when you enter the field, so it's important to be comfortable with these tools.

# What's skills matter?

There are many skills needed to excel in this field. For the purposes of this class, we'll focus on the following:

## Basic Computer Concepts

Building skills in organizing, accessing, and managing digital files efficiently.

## Operating Systems

Understanding how to use different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Spreadsheet Software

Developing proficiency in using spreadsheets for analyzing biological data.

## Word Processing Software

Becoming proficient with word processing and presentation tools such as Microsoft Office and Google Workspace.

## Database Software

Learning how to use and manage databases, including the ability to store and retrieve biopharmaceutical data.

## ... and more

While this class will focus on these areas, keep in mind that concepts like automation, laboratory information management systems, security, and basic programming will also be valuable in your career. However, these are beyond the scope of what we'll cover here.

# Computer Essentials

Computers are the life blood of today's world. If they were to suddenly turn off, all at once, the power grid would shut down, cars would crash, and planes would fall, water treatment plants would stop, the stock market would freeze, and employees wouldn't get paid.

Computers have not just changed the biopharmaceutical industry, but almost all of our lives.

## What are computers?

They are just simple machines that perform complex actions through many layers opf abstraction. In the next few lectures we are going to break down those layers and build up from simple 1s and 0s to operating systems, the entire internet and beyond.

But before we get into the context of the computers we know and love today, we first need to understand the context behind them to better appreciate why there are so many different layers to begin with.

So let's start at the beginning...

# The People and the Inventions

## What's the earliest recognized device for computing?

The abacus, invented in Mesopotamia around 2500 BCE, is often recognized as the earliest computing device. Essentially, it is a hand-operated calculator. But why is it considered a computer? Despite being manually operated and lacking electronic components or software, the abacus performs calculations and processes data in a way that reflects the basic functions of modern computers. It embodies the fundamental principles of computation, serving as a precursor to today’s computing devices.

## What was the first use of the term computer?

Originally, the term "computer" referred to a person who performed calculations, often with the aid of machines. This role continued into the late 1800s, when the meaning of "computer" shifted from describing an occupation to referring to the machines we use today.

"As each increase of knowledge, as well on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes abridged." - Charles Babbage, the pioneer of computing

Or, in other words, "Why work if a machine can do it for you?"

## Why did we need to create faster computers?

Speed and accuracy are especially important on the battlefield which is why the military was the first to apply computing to complex problems. What sort of problems you may ask? Well, how to effectively fire your cannons at your enemies despite weather conditions. The weather unfortunately can affect how accurately you can plow down the opposing parties so there was a larger need for faster computing devices.

Somewhat ironically, the first "computer device" that was created was with the intent to destroy people as opposed to it's more altruistic intents in modern society.

## What is the first general purpose computer?

Charles Babbage spent over 2 decades creating a 15 ton computer and as you can imagine the project got discontinued as the cost to create the device became greater than the need to kill people lol. That being said, this is the first instance of formulating a general-purpose computation device and which is why he to this day establishes himself as the father of computing despite his project being was way ahead of it's time.

## What is the Analytical Engine?

The pros:

- Capable of performing various computations, not limited to a single task
- Could be given data and run operations in sequence
- Featured memory and a primitive printer
- Implemented conditional branches and looping, concepts that all the computer nerds continue to love to this day.

The cons:

- Never fully constructed due to being ahead of its time
- Being "easily transportable" was not a top priority during its design

In summary: The ability to automate a series of operations was groundbreaking and foreshadowed the development of modern computer programs

# The First Programmer

The Analytical Engine would inspire, arguably, the first generation of computer scientists. It was not long after it's proposition that Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, wrote hypothetical programs that could be run on the machine.

She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and went on to publish the first ever algorithm intended to be carried out by the Analytical Engine.

Consequently, she is considered the world's first programmer. Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine demonstrated a deep understanding of the machine’s potential, including concepts like looping and conditional branching, which are fundamental to modern programming.
