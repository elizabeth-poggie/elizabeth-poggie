## TEACHING METHODS

This course consists of _60 hours_ of scheduled lectures and lab work. In addition, each student will be required to do _30 hours_ of personal study that includes research, computer time and work at home. Most of the personal study time requires working with a computer. Léa, the course management system within Omnivox, will be used in this course.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

We all have our own ways of learning, and I respect what works best for you. However, I've noticed over time that students who skip every class often struggle to pass, as many of the activities I plan are closely tied to the course material. If you're sitting at a 58 and need a grade bump to pass and avoid repeating the course, students who consistently show up and put in the effort in person are more likely to receive that support.

## OTHER POLICIES

Refer to the doc on Lea if you're keen on using your free time to read legal jargon

## CHEATING

Don't do it. I know when you do it. I know if you are lying. I am required by contract to report it, and just like how you're interested in earning your degree, I'm interested in maintaining my current employment :^)

# Office Hours

- Monday, 2:30pm - 5:00pm
- Thursday, 1:30pm - 3:00pm
- Friday, 12:00pm - 1:00pm

# How to get in touch

The response time depends on which platform you reach out on:

- P237 👉 Less than 1 min
- Teams 👉 >5 mins to 1 day
- MIO 👉 2 to 3 business days
- elizabeth.poggie@johnabbott.qc.ca 👉 3 to 5 business days
- Instragram 👉 Never.

# What to expect

With my background in running large-scale events, I try to design in-class activities to feel like a gamified version of the actual material. My goal is for you to have fun doing them as much as I have fun organizing them.

# Two Truths and a Lie

We’ll go around the room, and each person will share their name along with what they did this summer.
