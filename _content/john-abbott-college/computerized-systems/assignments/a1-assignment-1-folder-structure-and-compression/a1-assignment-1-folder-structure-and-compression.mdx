# Overview

- Worth: This assignment contributes `7%` to the Assignment portion of your final grade.
- Due: `September 12 by 23:59`
- Submission: Upload a `.zip` file containing your work folder to LEA. The file should be named `Assignment-1-ID.zip` where `ID` is your student ID.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose `10%` per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# Part 1: Folder Structure & Compression

Follow the steps below to create the required folder structure and correctly categorize each file by placing it in the appropriate folder.

- Download the file `assignment_1_files.zip` from Lea.
- Extract the content of the `.zip` file in a location of your choice.
- Organize the files into folders as follows:
  - Create a main folder called `assignment_1`. This will serve as the top-level folder for your assignment.
  - Set up the folder structure shown below (only folders are listed).

```md
assignment-1
├── audio
├── documents
│ ├── pdfs
│ ├── spreadsheets
│ ├── text
│ │ ├── word-documents
│ │ ├── other
├── images
├── videos
```

- Place each file into its correct folder based on its file type.
  - Check the file extensions to determine the type of file you are working with.
  - If you're unsure how to categorize a file, search for its extension online to understand its type.
- Review the properties of the Audio, Documents, Images, and Videos folders, and note their sizes in megabytes (MB). This information will be important for Part 3 of the assignment.
- Individually compress each one of the folders listed above (Audio, Documents, Images, and Videos) and take note of the file size after compression in mega-bytes. You will need this information for Part 3.
- Delete any uncompressed files.

# Part 2 - Creating New Files

In this section, you will create two new files and place them in the _top-level_ folder.

- Create a Microsoft Word document and type your name inside it.
  - Save it as the name `Compression Ratios.docx`.
- Create an empty Microsoft Excel document.
  - Save the file as `Excel1.xlsx`.

# Part 3 - Word

In this section, you will use the data collected from Part 1 to show the relative compression of each folder by creating a table in Microsoft Word.

- Open the `Compression Ratios.docx` file that you created in Part 2.
- Insert a table with four columns. The column names should be:

  - _Folder Name_ (the name of your folder)
  - _Size Before_ (folder size before compression, from Part 1)
  - _Size After_ (folder size after compression, from Part 1)
  - _Relative Compression_ (a value you will calculate, explained below)

- For each folder you compressed in Part 1, enter the information into a new row under the corresponding column.
  - The _Relative Compression_ is how much the folder size changed after compression compared to its original size.
  - To calculate it, divide the final size (after compression) by the original size (before compression):

```text
Relative Compression = ( final size )/( original size )
```

- Highlight the folder with the best compression (the one that compressed the most) in green.
- Highlight the folder with the worst compression (the one that compressed the least or did not shrink) in orange.

# Submission

- Compress the top level folder `Assignment_1` (which contains all your work).
- Upload the compressed folder to OneDrive and share the link with me on MIO
- Submit the compressed folder to LEA under the `Assignment #1` section.
