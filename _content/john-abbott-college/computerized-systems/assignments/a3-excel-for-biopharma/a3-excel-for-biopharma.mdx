# The Goal

## Tips

Do not copy and paste the data from Atlantic Hurricane Stats. Everything in this assignment is done using relative or absolute references.

# Instructions

## Extracting Insights

In the Analysis sheet, compute the total number of storms for each year by adding up the Named Storms, Hurricanes, and Major Hurricanes.

## Statistical Summary

In the summary sheet, write formulas in the proper cells of the following:

- The most total storms
- The least total storms
- The average number of total storms
- Standard Deviation using the right formula

## Statistical Analysis

In the Analysis sheet, now compute the following for each year by writing out the formulas:

- The percent difference from the minimum number of total storms.
- The percent difference from the maximum number of total storms.
- Calculate the difference between the total storms and number of named storms. How prevalent are unnamed storms each year in comparison to named storms?

A High Positive Percent Difference indicates a particularly active year while a high Negative Percent Difference suggests a below-average year. What does your data suggest?

## Formatting

In the Analysis sheet, add the following formatting changes:

- Use proper number formatting to display the values in as percentages when necessary and remove all digits after the decimal place.
- Freeze the column headers so its easier to navigate the data as you scroll down
- Add custom styling to make it cuter than the default excel sheets

In the Summary sheet, add the following formatting changes:

- For all number values, remove all digits after the decimal place. (e.g. you have have 1.5 storms, you either have 1 storm or 2 storms)
- Make your table cuter and consistent with your table in the Analysis sheet.
- For the year with the most storms, insert the image associated with that year in the sheet and resize it so it's not massive. You can find the image by clicking on the link of the associated year in "Atlantic Hurricane Stats"

## Chart Analysis

In the summary sheet insert a line chart, with the year on the X axis, the total storms on the Y axis in one color, and the total named storms on the Y axis in another color.

## Trends

Add a linear forecast for the total storms and total named storms to make projections for the future up to 2050 and add the equations to the chart. What insights can you gather about what we should expect to see in the coming years?

# Rubric
