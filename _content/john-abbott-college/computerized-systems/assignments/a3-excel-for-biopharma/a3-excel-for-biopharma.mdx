# The Goal

# Instructions

## Extracting Insights

In the Analysis sheet, compute the total number of storms for each year by adding up the Named Storms, Hurricanes, and Major Hurricanes.

## Statistical Summary

In the summary sheet, write formulas in the proper cells of the following:

- The year with the most storms and the total number
- The year with the least storms and the total number
- The average number of total storms
- Standard Deviation using the right formula

## Statistical Analysis

In the Analysis sheet, now compute the following for each year by writing out the formulas:

- The percent difference from the average minimum number of total storms
- Percent difference from the average minimum temperature, and
- Percent difference from the mean.
- Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures (Max - Min).

## Formatting

In the Analysis sheet, use proper number formatting to display the values in as percentages when necessary.

In both the Analysis and Summary sheets, all numbers should be displayed without digits after the decimal point. (e.g. you have have 1.5 storms, you either have 1 storm or 2 storms)

## Chat Analysis

Insert a line chart, with the date on the X axis, and the mean temperature on the Y axis.

- Add title “Daily mean temperature” to your chart.
- Change the line color to green
- Change the markers to be squares of size 7. The markers should be green.
- Change the y-axis so that it's minimum value is 5 degree Celsius.
- Don’t hide the data with your chart. Move it just below the data in the sheet.

## Trends

- Add a linear trend line to the chart and display the equation on the chart.
- Add a linear forecast

# Rubric

- Formulas for Average, Min, Max, and Standard deviation
- Difference formulas
- Formatting
- Formula for difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures
