# Overview

- Worth: This assignment contributes `9%` to the Assignment portion of your final grade.
- Due: `October 22 by 23:59`
- Submission: Upload a `.zip` file containing your work folder to LEA. The file should be named `Assignment-3-ID.zip` where `ID` is your student ID.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose `10%` per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# The Goal

Hurricanes are increasingly dominating the news, with both their size and impact growing each year. In this assignment, you will examine the North Atlantic Ocean Historical Tropical Cyclone Statistics. Through this analysis, you will extract insights from hard facts and make predictions for the upcoming years.

## Tips

Please do not copy and paste data from Atlantic Hurricane Stats. All calculations in this assignment should utilize relative or absolute references.

# Instructions

## Extracting Insights

In the Analysis sheet, calculate the total number of storms for each year by summing the Named Storms, Hurricanes, and Major Hurricanes.

## Statistical Summary

In the Summary sheet, create formulas in the appropriate cells for the following:

- The most total storms
- The least total storms
- The average number of total storms
- Standard deviation using the appropriate formula

## Statistical Analysis

In the Analysis sheet, compute the following for each year by writing the necessary formulas:

- The percent difference from the minimum number of total storms. A high positive percent difference indicates a particularly active year, while a high negative percent difference suggests a below-average year. What conclusions can you draw from your data?
- The percent difference from the maximum number of total storms.
- The difference between total storms and the number of named storms. How do unnamed storms compare to named storms each year?

_Sample calculations_ ðŸ‘‰ Let's say the total number of storms for this year was 22, and the maximum number of storms was 50. To calculate the percent difference from the maximum number of total storms, follow this formula:

```text
(22-50)/50 = -56%
```

## Formatting

In the Analysis sheet, implement the following formatting changes:

- Use proper number formatting to display values as percentages where necessary and remove all digits after the decimal place.
- Freeze the column headers for easier navigation as you scroll down.
- Apply custom styling to make the table cuter instead of using the default Excel layout. (e.g. that's ugly and hard to look at)

In the Summary sheet, apply these formatting changes:

- Remove all digits after the decimal place for all number values (e.g., if you have 1.5 storms, record it as either 1 or 2 storms).
- Make your table cuter and consistent with the table in the Analysis sheet.
- For the year with the most storms, insert the associated image into the sheet and resize it appropriately. You can find this image by clicking the link for the corresponding year in "Atlantic Hurricane Stats".

## Chart Analysis

In the Summary sheet, insert a line chart with the year on the X-axis and total storms on the Y-axis in one color, and total named storms on the Y-axis in another color.

## Trends

Add a linear forecast for total storms and total named storms to project trends up to 2050, and include the equations on the chart. What insights can you gather about what we should expect to see in the coming years?

# Submission

Please rename the Excel sheet to `stats-ID.xlsx`, replacing ID with your student ID. Save this file in a folder named `Assignment-3-ID`. Once you have zipped the folder, upload the `.zip` file to LEA.

# Rubric

For this assignment, I will specifically be looking for the following:

- Statistical Summary - Includes all the required metrics.
- Data Analysis - Thorough and accurate calculations for total storms and necessary formulas.
- Formatting - Excellent formatting in both sheets. (Do not use the Excel Defaults)
- Chart - Unique line chart with clear labels and legends.
- Trend Analysis - Linear forecast up to year 2050 with clear equations.
- Follows Submission Guidelines - all files named and formatted correctly.
