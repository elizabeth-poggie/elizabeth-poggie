# The Goal

Using the provided data on the assign4_data.xlsx spreadsheet complete the sections below.

# Part 1

Refer to sheet Isotopes and follow the below instructions

## Styling 💅✨

- Format the data part of the sheet as a table. Apply any predefined table style to it.
- Freeze the table headers as well as column A so that they remain visible when scrolling.

## Conditional formatting 🤨

- All Isotope cells containing a value greater than or equal to 200 should have a light red fill with red text (the cell only, not the whole row)
- The rows with “beta” as the type of radiation produced should have a yellow fill color (yellow background). The whole rows should have a yellow background, not just the cells in the radiation produced column. (This is a challenge and might require some research)

## Sorting and Filtering 🕵️‍♂️

- Sort by the radiation produced first (reverse alphabetical order), then by the symbol (alphabetical order)
- Filter the table to keep only the medical and research uses.

# Part 2

Refer to sheet SupportCalls and follow the below instructions

## Styling 💅✨

- Freeze panes so that the column headers (Row 3) remain visible when scrolling.
- Replace all occurrences of Virus by Malware.

## Mathe(magic) 🧮 🧙‍♀️

- Add a new column to the table named Duration.
- Create a formula to calculate the days required to resolve the incident (Date Resolved minus Date created). Include the units in the column header. Tickets that are still open do not have a Date Resolved, in which case the duration should indicate "N/A".
- Write a formula in all cells of column H to display ticket Status as "Open" or "Closed", according to the column Date Resolved.
- Write the proper formula in the light blue cells to return the required values.

## Sorting and Filtering 🕵️‍♂️

- Sort the table by Agent Name in alphabetic order. Add a second level to sort by Description as follows: Won't power on, Virus, Printing Issues, Software Update, Forgotten Password. Add a third level to sort by Duration from smallest to largest.
- Filter the table to only display closed incidents as indicated in the Status column.
