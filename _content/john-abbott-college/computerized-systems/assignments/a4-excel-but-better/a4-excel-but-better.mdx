# Part 1

[The Chernobyl disaster](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/) serves as a stark reminder of the long-term consequences of human error. Decades later, the repercussions of this catastrophe continue to affect the world and now it's your job the analyze the numbers. You are currently interning at a renowned research lab and have been tasked with conducting a brief analysis on the half-lives of various radioactive isotopes.

Refer to the `Isotopes` sheet and follow the instructions provided below.

## Styling ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ú®

- Organize the data in the sheet as a formatted table and apply any predefined table style so it looks more sleek
- Ensure the table headers and column A are frozen to remain visible while scrolling

## Conditional formatting ü§®

- Apply conditional formatting so that any isotope cell containing a value of 200 or higher has a light red fill with red text. Make sure the formatting applies only to the cell, not the entire row!
- Highlight entire rows in yellow if the type of radiation produced is ‚Äúbeta.‚Äù This requires the whole row to have a yellow background, not just the cell containing the radiation type. (This may be challenging and you may need to google beyond these notes)

## Sorting üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sort the data by the type of radiation produced in reverse alphabetical order, followed by sorting by the symbol in alphabetical order

## Filtering üßº

Apply a filter to display only rows where the use is categorized as medical or research

# Part 2

No fun pitch this time. Refer to sheet `SupportCalls` and follow the below instructions:

## Formatting and Layout üíÖ‚ú®

- Freeze the panes so that the column headers (Row 3) stay visible while scrolling through the data
- Replace every occurrence of the word "Virus" with "Malware" throughout the sheet

## Mathe(magic) üßÆ üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Add a new column named Duration to the table using column J. In this column, create a formula that calculates the number of days taken to resolve each incident by subtracting the Date Created from the _Date Resolved_. Make sure the column header specifies the unit (e.g., "Duration (days)").

```text
Duration = Date Resolved - Date Created
```

For incidents that are still open and lack a _Date Resolved_, display "N/A" in the Duration column.

## Conditional formatting ü§®

- In column H, write a formula for each cell that displays the ticket Status as either "Open" or "Closed" based on whether the Date Resolved field is filled or empty.
- Ensure the correct formulas are applied to the light blue cells to yield the needed values.

## Sorting üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sort the table by Agent Name in alphabetical order. Add a second sorting level to organize by Duration, from the shortest to longest time.

## Filtering üßº

Filter the table to only display closed incidents as indicated in the Status column.

# Submission

Please rename the Excel sheet to `assign4-ID.xlsx`, replacing ID with your student ID. Save this file in a folder named `Assignment-4-ID`. Once you have zipped the folder, upload the `.zip` file to LEA.
