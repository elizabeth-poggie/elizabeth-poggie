Figure 1: you rolling in the fruits of your labour

# Part 1

Refer to the `Product Sales` sheet and follow the instructions provided below.

## Styling

- Freeze the top row
- Apply custom styling
- Ensure all column headers are readable and centered
- Ensure all the columns are formatted with _the proper data types_ (Currency, Percentage, etc.)

## Weekly Prescription Revenue by City

- In Column G, calculate the Total Weekly Prescription Revenue by City using the below formula:

```text
"Weekly Prescription Count" x "Price per Prescription"
```

- Give the column a header with a meaningful name
- Create a Pivot Table on _a new worksheet_ where each city is a row and the values are the weekly revenue
- Finally, give this new worksheet a meaningful name

## Population Coverage by Price Bracket

- Create another Pivot table on the same worksheet you created before
- Group the "Price per Prescription" field into ranges (e.g., $15–$30, $31–$60, etc.) by right clicking on the pivot table and selecting the "Group" option
- Determine which price bracket covers the largest population by highlighting the cell in yellow

## Patients Income by Price Bracket

- Using the same pivot table worksheet as before, create another Pivot Table
- Determine which price bracket corresponds to higher average patient income by highlighting the cell in yellow
- Be sure to use the same "Price per Prescription" groups as before

## Chart Analysis

- Using a Pivot Chart, show the relationship between grouped prescription price and weekly prescription counts _across all cities_
- Add a Linear trendline with it's equation on the table. If you release a new product at a higher price point, how do you think it will be received? Write your conclusion somewhere easily found by Poggie

## Part 2

Refer to the `Order Delivery` sheet and follow the instructions provided below.

## Styling

- Freeze the top row
- Apply the SAME custom styling as in Part 1
- Ensure all column headers are readable and centered

Using the Lecture 18 notes, complete the following:

- Create a histogram for ONLY the distribution of order delivery days
- Set bin width to 5
- Set the overflow bin to 30
- Add axis titles

## Discovery

Using Google or ChatGPT, on the same histogram, add "Outside End" data labels.
