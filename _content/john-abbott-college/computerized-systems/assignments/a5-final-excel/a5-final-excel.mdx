# Part 1

Refer to the `Product Sales` sheet and follow the instructions provided below.

## Styling

- Freeze the top row
- Apply custom styling to the sheet
- Ensure all column headers are readable and centered
- Format all columns with the correct data types (e.g. Currency, Percentage)

## Weekly Prescription Revenue by City

In Column G, calculate the "Total Weekly Prescription Revenue" by City using the formula:

```text
"Weekly Prescription Count" x "Price per Prescription"
```

- Assign a meaningful header to this column
- Create a Pivot Table on a new worksheet, where each city is represented as a row and the values are the weekly revenue
- Finally, give the new worksheet a meaningful name

## Population Coverage by Price Bracket

- On the same worksheet you created earlier, add another Pivot Table
- Group the "Price per Prescription" field into ranges (e.g., $15â€“$30, $31â€“$60, etc)
- Identify which price bracket covers the largest population and _highlight_ the corresponding cells in yellow

ðŸ’¡ Tip: To create ranges, right-click on the Pivot Table and select the "Group" option.

## Patients Income by Price Bracket

- Using the same Pivot Table worksheet as before, create another Pivot Table
- Find the price bracket that corresponds to the highest average patient income and _highlight_ the cells in yellow
- Be sure to use the SAME price ranges for "Price per Prescription" as you did before

## Chart Analysis

- Create a Pivot Chart to show the relationship between the grouped prescription price and weekly prescription counts _across all cities_.
- Add a linear trendline to the chart AND display its equation.
- If a new product is released at a higher price point, predict how it will be received.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Write your conclusion somewhere easy for Poggie to discover ðŸ‘€

# Part 2

Refer to the `Order Delivery` sheet and follow the instructions provided below.

## Styling

- Freeze the top row.
- Apply the SAME custom styling as in Part 1
- Make sure all column headers are clear and centered
- Format all columns with the correct data types

## Histogram

Using the _Lecture 18_ notes, complete the following:

- Create a histogram that displays _only_ the distribution of order delivery days
- Set bin width to 5
- Set the overflow bin to 30
- Add meaningful axis titles for clarity

## Discovery

Using Google or ChatGPT, add "Outside End" data labels to the histogram

# Submission

Rename the Excel sheet to `A5-ID.xlsx`, replacing ID with your student ID. Save this file in a folder named `A5-ID`. Once you have zipped the folder, upload the `.zip` file to LEA.
