# Access Tables

We will look into the following aspects of working with tables:

- Viewing tables and moving through records.
- Modifying and saving records.
- Creating a Table from scratch.
- Creating a Table with data from Excel.

## Documentation

üìñ For this section of the notes please refer to the following resources:

- [Working with Tables](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/access2016/working-with-tables/1/) from GCF Global
- [Modifying Tables](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/access2016/modifying-tables/1/) from GCF Global
- [Build tables and set data types](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/video-build-tables-and-set-data-types-997c250d-aec6-4430-8de5-a08671e13921?wt.mc_id=otc_access) from Microsoft

## Read the Warnings ‚ö† üëÄ

Databases are designed to limit user error. Because of this, Access is very picky about how it "should" be used.

It is _very common_ to get warning messages when doing operations in Access.

Therefore, warning messages often present useful information on how to proceed or how to correct a mistake.

# Primary Keys üîë

Every table must have a field that works as the primary key.

- The primary key works as a _unique ID_ for each record in the table.
- A table can only have ONE primary key

For example, your student ID at John Abbott is a form of primary key for a student account table üè´

Can you think of other primary keys?

## Keys && Table Creation

When you create a table from scratch, the _first column will always be selected as the Primary Key_. This can be changed later if desired.

# Data Integrity

Databases should be designed to reduce user error and guarantee data integrity.

Access offers several ways enforcing data integrity.

## Data Type Categories

The two most common:

- Defining fields with data types
- Data validation for each field

## Data types

Every field in the table must be assigned a data type. There are several data types to choose from.

Data types are helpful in the following ways:

- To guide the type of data permitted in each field.
- To control the size of data entered in each field.

## Documentation

For a description of all the available data types, see [Data types for Access desktop databases](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/data-types-for-access-desktop-databases-df2b83ba-cef6-436d-b679-3418f622e482) by Microsoft

## Type Restriction

To control the number of characters permitted in each field:

- Select the desired field to be controlled
- Change the value of **_Field Size_**

# Data Validation

It is possible to validate the data being entered into a field in order to reduce mistakes.

## Rule Example

Consider the field `Registration Date`. Let's apply a validation rule where all entered dates need to be:

- Either the current date, ORRRRRR ....
- Be in the future

It's possible to combine multiple validation rules with the keywords: OR , AND

## Step by Step

- Step 1) Select the `Registration Date` field
- Step 2) Select `Field Validation Rule` from the `Fields menu`
- Step 3) Use the `_`Expression Builder` to create a validation rule
- Step 4) Add a `Field Validation Message` that users will see when they enter data that does not follows your validation rule

# Importing Data from Excel

To import data from an existing Excel sheet do the following:

- Select the _External Data_ menu
- Select _New Data Source_
- Select _From File_ and choose _Excel_

## Wizard Conversion

Follow the wizard to choose how to convert your data and pay close attention to the following:

- Select if you will create a new table or append it to an existing table
- Carefully check the data type for each field
- Decide on a primary key
  - You can either use a column from the spreadsheet or
  - Let Access create a new field as the primary key.

# Exercise

Download the file _Departments.xlsx_

- Start a new database and create a table to hold the data contained in the Excel - Populate the first 3 records of the table manually
- Add the following data validation:
  - The department ID is only 2 characters long.
  - The phone numbers are no longer than 15 characters.
  - The suite Number must be bigger than 500.
