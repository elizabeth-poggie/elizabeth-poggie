# Access Tables

In this section, we will cover the following aspects of working with tables:

- Viewing tables and navigating through records.
- Modifying and saving records.
- Creating a table from scratch.
- Importing data from Excel to create a table.

## Read the Warnings ⚠ 👀

Access databases are built to reduce user errors, which means the system has strict rules about how it should be used.

It is very common to encounter warning messages when performing operations in Access.

These warning messages are not just alerts—they often contain helpful information about what went wrong and how to fix it. Pay attention to them to ensure smoother workflows and fewer mistakes.

# Primary Keys 🔑

Every table needs a field that serves as its primary key.

- The primary key acts as a unique identifier for each record in the table.
- A table can have only one primary key.

## Everyday Examples

For example, your student ID at John Abbott functions as a primary key in a student account table 🏫.

Can you think of other examples of primary keys?

- SIN numbers
- Order numbers
- Product barcodes
- others

## Keys && Table Creation

When you create a table from scratch, the first column is automatically set as the primary key.

If you need a different field to act as the primary key, you can change this setting later. Make sure the field you choose is unique and consistently applied to _avoid data conflicts_.

# Data Integrity

Databases are designed to minimize user errors and ensure data integrity.

Microsoft Access provides several tools to help enforce data integrity, keeping your database accurate and consistent.

## Data Type Categories

Two key methods for maintaining data integrity are:

- Defining fields with specific data types.
- Validating the data entered into each field.

## Data types

Every field in a table must be assigned a data type. Access offers a variety of data types to suit different needs.

Data types are essential for:

- Guiding what kind of data is allowed in each field.
- Controlling the size of the data entered, which can improve storage efficiency and reduce errors.

Examples include text, numbers, dates, and more.

## Documentation

For a description of all the available data types, see [Data types for Access desktop databases](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/data-types-for-access-desktop-databases-df2b83ba-cef6-436d-b679-3418f622e482) by Microsoft

## Type Restriction

To limit the number of characters allowed in a field:

- Select the field you want to modify.
- Adjust the Field Size property to specify the maximum character limit.

# Data Validation

Validating the data entered into fields helps reduce errors and maintain the integrity of your database.

## Rule Example

Let’s say we have a field called Registration Date. We can create a validation rule to ensure that:

- The date entered is either today ORRRRRRR
- a future date

To create more complex rules, you can use the keywords OR and AND to combine multiple conditions.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

- Step 1) Select the Registration Date field in your table
- Step 2) Go to the Fields menu and choose Field Validation Rule.
- Step 3) Use the Expression Builder to set up your validation rule. Example: >= Date() to ensure dates are today or later.
- Step 4) Add a Field Validation Message to inform users when their input does not meet the rule. Example: "Please enter a date that is today or in the future."

# Importing Data from Excel

To import data from an existing Excel sheet, follow these steps:

- Open the External Data menu.
- Choose New Data Source.
- Select From File and then Excel.

## Wizard Conversion

The import wizard will guide you through the process. Pay close attention to:

- Choosing whether to create a new table or append the data to an existing one.
- Verifying the data type for each field to ensure accuracy.
- Deciding on a primary key:
  - You can select an existing column in the spreadsheet.
  - Alternatively, let Access generate a new primary key field.

# Exercise

Download the file `Departments.xlsx` and complete the following steps:

- Create a new database and a table to store the data from the Excel file.
- Manually input the first three records into the table.
- Add the following data validation rules:
  - Department ID must be exactly 2 characters long
  - Phone numbers cannot exceed 15 characters
  - Suite Number must be greater than 500

This exercise will help you practice importing, creating tables, and applying validation rules in Access.
