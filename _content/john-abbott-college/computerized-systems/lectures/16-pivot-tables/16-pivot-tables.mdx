# PivotTables

## What are they?

When you have a lot of data, it can sometimes be difficult to analyze all of the information in your worksheet. PivotTables can help make your worksheets more manageable.

## What are you looking for?

PivotTables are very flexible and can be organized in many different ways, HOWEVER, It is not always clear how to organize the rows, columns and values of a PivotTable.

## How do you get started?

To help you organize the table, you need first to understand what kind of information you are trying to extract from the data. From the question being asked, try to identify:

```cs
"What am I trying to measure?"
```

This helps you determine the **Value** that you are looking for.

```cs
"How do I want this data organized?"
```

This helps you determine what are the **columns and rows** of your table.

## Concrete Example

Consider the table below:

If we wanted to answer the following question:

```cs
"How much was sold by each salesperson on a monthly basis?"
```

Using the original way of doing things, solving that question WILL BE difficult since each salesperson appears on multiple rows, and we would need to total all of their different orders individually. Instead let's take a new approach with PivotTables. For this we need to answer these questions:

- What are we trying to measure: **How much as sold.**
- How do we want this organized: **per salesperson and per month**.

In this case, we will add "Order Amount" to _Values_, "Salesperson" to the _Rows_, and "Month" to the _Columns_.

How do you decide what is a row and column? The correct order of row and columns depends on what is easier to visualize.

## Step 4) We love granularity

Let's group the lads according to region
