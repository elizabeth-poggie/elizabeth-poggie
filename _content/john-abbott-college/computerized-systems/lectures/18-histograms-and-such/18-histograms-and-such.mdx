# Creating a Histogram

## Why?

They help with visualizing data and help you see patterns

## Step 1) Inserting a Histogram

In the cute bar chart group, click on the Histogram chart icon:

## Step 2) Bin Modification

You have several options when it comes to organizing your histogram, all of which you can see by right clicking and selecting "Format Data Series". For example:

![demo](./assets/bins-histo.gif)

All available options include:

- Automatic
- By Category
- Bin Width (as shown in the `gif`)
- Number of Bins

These options let you control the _layout_ and _level_ of detail in your histogram.

# Intro to MS Access

Spreadsheets are useful for analyzing data, but they come with some significant limitations:

- Data within tables isn‚Äôt directly linked or associated with data in other tables
- Entering and retrieving data can be challenging and not particularly user-friendly
- It‚Äôs hard to enforce "data accuracy", meaning that Excel allows for inconsistencies like numbers being entered as words or dates.

## Why learn about databases?

In many real-world scenarios, the information we need is spread across multiple tables, and managing this in Excel can be painful. That's why we love Databases. They make it easier to organize, connect, and retrieve data.

## What are Databases?

Databases in Microsoft Access consist of four main objects: tables, queries, forms, and reports. Each of these objects serves a unique purpose, and together they allow you to enter, store, analyze, and compile data in a relatively painless way when compared to fancier Databases like SQL, GraphQL, and other neat Database tools.

# Tables

Tables store the data in a way that is similar to Excel.

There are some minor differences in terminology:

- **Records (rows)**: contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product.
- **Fields (columns):** contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address.
- **Field value (cell)**: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com.

# Queries

Since most tables are linked via different relationships, **queries** allows us to retrieve **specific data** from one of more tables.

- Queries need to be structured in order to ask specific questions.

For example:

_‚ÄúWhat is the name, email and address of all customers who ordered product X in the last 3 months ?‚Äù_

# Forms

Forms offers us a more user-friendly way of manipulating the data in the tables.

It‚Äôs the same **data from the tables** but in a **different visual format**.

It makes entering and modifying data easier and it allows users to enter data into multiple tables at once.

# Reports

Reports present data from any table or query. in an **easy-to-read** (or print) format.

It is possible to customize reports in order to make it visually appealing.
