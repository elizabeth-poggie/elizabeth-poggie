# Creating a Histogram

## Why?

They help with visualizing data and help you see patterns

## Step 1) Inserting a Histogram

In the cute bar chart group, click on the Histogram chart icon:

## Step 2) Bin Modification

You have several options when it comes to organizing your histogram, all of which you can see by right clicking and selecting "Format Data Series". For example:

![demo](./assets/bins-histo.gif)

All available options include:

- Automatic
- By Category
- Bin Width (as shown in the `gif`)
- Number of Bins

These options let you control the _layout_ and _level_ of detail in your histogram.

# Intro to MS Access

Spreadsheets are a great tool for analyzing data. However, they have the following limitations:

- Data in tables are not directly linked or associated to other tables
- Entering and retrieving data is not user friendly
- It is difficult to enforce that data is entered correctly (everything is possible: numbers vs words vs dates)

## Why learn about databases?

In practice, the information we are looking for is often distributed in amongst multiple tables and doing this in Excel is non-trivial. Databases makes this easier

## What are Databases?

Databases in Access are composed of four objects: tables, queries, forms, and reports. Together, these objects allow you to enter, store, analyze, and compile data however you want.

# Tables

Tables store the data in a way that is similar to Excel.

There are some minor differences in terminology:

- **Records (rows)**: contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product.
- **Fields (columns):** contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address.
- **Field value (cell)**: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com.

# Queries

Since most tables are linked via different relationships, **queries** allows us to retrieve **specific data** from one of more tables.

- Queries need to be structured in order to ask specific questions.

For example:

_‚ÄúWhat is the name, email and address of all customers who ordered product X in the last 3 months ?‚Äù_

# Forms

Forms offers us a more user-friendly way of manipulating the data in the tables.

It‚Äôs the same **data from the tables** but in a **different visual format**.

It makes entering and modifying data easier and it allows users to enter data into multiple tables at once.

# Reports

Reports present data from any table or query. in an **easy-to-read** (or print) format.

It is possible to customize reports in order to make it visually appealing.
