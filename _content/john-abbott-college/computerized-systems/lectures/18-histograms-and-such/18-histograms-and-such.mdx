## Step 2) Bin Modification

You have several options when it comes to organizing your histogram, all of which you can see by right clicking and selecting "Format Data Series". For example:

All available options include:

- Automatic
- By Category
- Bin Width (as shown in the `gif`)
- Number of Bins

These options let you control the _layout_ and _level_ of detail in your histogram.
