# Quick Recap

- Conditional Formatting
- Sorting
- Filtering

# If & Count

In some cases, it is desirable to manipulate data only if the data meets certain criteria.

## Real World Example

For example, for a list of student's grades, you might want to format the content in red if they are failing and green if they are passing.

## How do you do this?

To do this, we can use the `=IF` function in excel

The `=IF` function checks whether a condition is met. It returns one value if the condition is met (`TRUE`) and another value if the condition is not met (`FALSE`).

## What's the syntax?

```excel
=IF(condition, value if true, value if false)
```

- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ the criteria that we are checking. It must result in `true` or `false`.
- **Value if true** ðŸ‘‰ the new value of the cell if the **condition** is `true`. NOTE: If this value is a text, it must be wrapped in double quotes `""`
- **Value if false** ðŸ‘‰ the new value of the cell if the **condition** is `false`. NOTE: If this value is a text, it must be wrapped in double quotes `""`

## Example Continued

Instead of jumping straight to Conditional Formatting, let's create a new column called "status" and evaluate if the student has "PASSED" or "FAILED" using the below equation:

```excel
=IF(B2>=60, "PASS", "FAIL")
```

The condition is that the value inside cell B2 is greater than or equal to 60.

# Comparison Operations

There are a few comparison operators:

```md
| Operator | Description           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| <        | less than             |
| <=       | less than or equal to |
| >        | more than             |
| >        | more than or equal to |
| =        | equals to             |
| <>       | not equals to         |
```

## What can these guys compare?

When using the operators above, it's possible to compare:

- Text that wrapped in double quotes.
- Numbers
- Dates in other cells

# Exercise 1

# COUNTIF & SUMIF

The `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF` functions are similar to `=IF`. They will count and sum if a specific condition is met.

## What's the syntax?

```excel
=COUNTIF(range, condition)
=SUMIF(range, condition, sum range)
```

- **range** ðŸ‘‰
- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ the criteria that we are checking. It must result in `true` or `false`.
- **sum range** ðŸ‘‰ In the `=SUMIF` formula you can specify a range to be summed that is different from the range to be compared against the condition.

NOTE: For `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF`, _you must wrap the operator and the value with double quotes_

# Exercise 2

# Wildcards

Sometimes our condition is that a cell contains a keyword.

The `*` symbol (asterisk) can be used as a wild card to assume any value.

## Example:

To match any cell containing the text "Oak" we can perform the following `COUNTIF`:
