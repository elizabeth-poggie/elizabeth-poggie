# If & Count

Sometimes, we need to work with data only if it meets certain conditions. This is where Excel's `=IF` function comes in handy.

## Real world example

Letâ€™s say you have a list of student grades. You might want to highlight failing grades in red and passing grades in green so you know which students need to be reached out to. To determine if a student is passing or failing, we can use the `=IF` function.

## How does this function work?

The `=IF` function evaluates a condition. It returns one value if the condition is `true` and a different value if it is `false`.

## Syntax

```excel
=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ This is the logical test, which should evaluate to either `true` or `false`.
- **Value if true** ðŸ‘‰ What to return if the condition is `true`. If this value is text, it must be enclosed in double quotes (`""`)
- **Value if false** ðŸ‘‰ What to return if the condition is `false`. Similarly, if this value is text, it should be wrapped in double quotes (`""`)

## Example Continued

Before jumping into Conditional Formatting, letâ€™s create a new column called "Status" to track whether each student has "PASSED" or "FAILED." Here's how you could write the formula:

```excel
=IF(B2>=60, "PASS", "FAIL")
```

In this example, the condition checks whether the value in cell B2 is greater than or equal to 60.

# Comparison Operations

Comparison operators are used to define the conditions for the `IF` function and other Excel formulas. Some are listed below:

```md
| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| <        | Less than                |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| >        | Greater than             |
| >        | Greater than or equal to |
| =        | Equal to                 |
| <>       | Not equal to             |
```

## What can these guys compare?

With these operators, you can compare:

- Text (wrapped in double quotes)
- Numbers
- Dates in other cells

# COUNTIF & SUMIF

The `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF` functions are similar to `=IF`. They help you count or sum values based on a condition.

## Syntax

```excel
=COUNTIF(range, condition)
=SUMIF(range, condition, sum range)
```

- **range** ðŸ‘‰
- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ the criteria that we are checking. It must result in `true` or `false`.
- **sum range** ðŸ‘‰ In the `=SUMIF` formula you can specify a range to be summed that is different from the range to be compared against the condition.

NOTE: For `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF`, _you must wrap the operator and the value with double quotes_

# Exercise 2

# Wildcards

Sometimes our condition is that a cell contains a keyword.

The `*` symbol (asterisk) can be used as a wild card to assume any value.

## Example:

To match any cell containing the text "Oak" we can perform the following `COUNTIF`:
