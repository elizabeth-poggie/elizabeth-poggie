# If

Sometimes, we need to work with data only if it meets certain conditions. This is where Excel's `=IF` function comes in handy.

## Real world example

Letâ€™s say you have a list of student grades. You might want to highlight failing grades in red and passing grades in green so you know which students need to be reached out to. To determine if a student is passing or failing, we can use the `=IF` function.

## How does this function work?

The `=IF` function evaluates a condition. It returns one value if the condition is `true` and a different value if it is `false`.

## Syntax

```excel
=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ This is the logical test, which should evaluate to either `true` or `false`.
- **Value if true** ðŸ‘‰ What to return if the condition is `true`. If this value is text, it must be enclosed in double quotes (`""`)
- **Value if false** ðŸ‘‰ What to return if the condition is `false`. Similarly, if this value is text, it should be wrapped in double quotes (`""`)

## Example Continued

Before jumping into Conditional Formatting, letâ€™s create a new column called "Status" to track whether each student has "PASSED" or "FAILED." Here's how you could write the formula:

```excel
=IF(B2>=60, "PASS", "FAIL")
```

In this example, the condition checks whether the value in cell B2 is greater than or equal to 60.

## Comparison Operations

Comparison operators are used to define the conditions for the `IF` function and other Excel formulas. Some are listed below:

```md
| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| <        | Less than                |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| >        | Greater than             |
| >        | Greater than or equal to |
| =        | Equal to                 |
| <>       | Not equal to             |
```

## What can these guys compare?

With these operators, you can compare:

- Text (wrapped in double quotes)
- Numbers
- Dates in other cells

# Exercise 1

In the workbook attached on Lea, under the Exercise 1 && 2 tab, complete the following tasks:

- In the "Upper Limit Status" column, check the tablet thickness values. If a tablet's thickness is above the upper limit, label it as "DEFECT". If it's below or equal to the upper limit, mark it as "OK"
- In the "Lower Limit Status" column, check the tablet thickness values again. If a tablet's thickness is below the lower limit, label it as "DEFECT". If it's above or equal to the lower limit, mark it as "OK"

Leave the other stuff blank for now

# More on Boolean Algebra

Understanding Boolean logic is crucial for more advanced Excel functions. Boolean operators (such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) allow you to combine multiple conditions and create complex formulas.

Going back to what we discussed last class, a tablet it "out of control" if it falls outside the control limits. In other words, its either ABOVE the upper limit, or BELOW the lower limit.

This can be abstracted like so:

```excel
=OR(E2="DEFECT", F2="DEFECT")
```

There is a lot more you can do with this sort of logic, however this is to get you started.

## Another example

Consider an example where an employee is classified as senior if they have been employed before January 1, 2018, and currently hold the position of manager.

I could filter this data directly, or I could create a new status column to make it clearer:

```excel
=IF(AND(C2<=DATE(2018,1,1), B2="Manager"), "senior", "baby")
```

This approach is useful because it allows us to easily count all the senior occurrences using the following formulas...

# COUNTIF && SUMIF

The `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF` functions are similar to `=IF`. They help you count or sum values based on a condition.

## Syntax

```excel
=COUNTIF(range, condition)
=SUMIF(range, condition, sum range)
```

- **range** ðŸ‘‰ The range of cells to apply the condition to
- **Condition** ðŸ‘‰ The criteria to evaluate (it must return either `true` or `false`)
- **sum range** ðŸ‘‰ In the `=SUMIF` formula, this specifies which range of cells to sum. It can be different from the range where you apply the condition.

ðŸ’¡ NOTE: In `=COUNTIF` and `=SUMIF`, if you're using comparison operators, they must be wrapped in double quotes along with the value (e.g. `">=60"`)

# Example 2

Going back to our employment example, now we can easily compute how many seniors are present in a company:

```excel
=COUNTIF(E2:E21, "senior")
```

ez.

# Exercise 2

In the workbook attached on Lea, under the Exercise 1 & 2 tab, complete the following tasks:

- Determine the "Is defect?" status in the final column based on the upper and lower limits.
- Using the `=COUNTIF` function, calculate the total number of defects and total OK entries by referencing the values in the "Is defect?" column

Place the results next to "Total Defects" and "Total OK".

# Wildcards

Wildcards are useful when your condition needs to check for partial matches. The `*` symbol (asterisk) is a wildcard that can represent any sequence of characters.

## Example

To count cells that contain the text "Oak" (e.g., "Oak Tree" or "Red Oak"), you can use:

```excel
=COUNTIF(A1:A10, "*Oak*")
```

This will count any cell that contains the word "Oak."
