# Combo Charts

## Secondary Axis

A typical graph is made of one X axis and one Y axis. However, sometimes different types of data can be collected on the same item.

In Excel we can add a Secondary axis to display two sets of data **as long as the data shares a common axis**.

## Why do we want this?

If there is a relationship between these different types of measurements you might want to show it in the same graph.

## How do you do that?

Refer to the [official microsoft documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-a-secondary-axis-in-a-chart-in-excel-91da1e2f-5db1-41e9-8908-e1a2e14dd5a9) for a step by step procedure
