# Conditional Formatting

You don’t need to create a full control chart to determine whether tablets are in good condition or defective. Instead, we can use conditional formatting to make this information stand out clearly.

## How?

Let's go back to this diagram:

![demo](./assets/1.png)

A tablet is considered "under control" when its value falls between `average - 1 sigma` AND `average + 1 sigma`:

![demo](./assets/2.png)

A tablet is considered "out of control" when its value falls outside the range of `average - 3 sigma` OR `average + 3 sigma`

## What does this look like in Excel?

Let’s start with the condition that a tablet is "under control". The logic can be described like this:

```text
thickness >= average - 1 sigma

AND

thickness <= average + 1 sigma
```

We can translate this logic into a simple Excel function:

```excel
=AND($B2>=$D2, $B2<=$C2)
```

Similarly, for defective tablets ("out of control"), the logic is:

```text
thickness < average - 3 sigma

OR

thickness > average + 3 sigma
```

In Excel, it looks like this:

```excel
=OR($B2>$G2, $B2<$H2)
```

## How do you apply conditional formatting?

To format your table based on these control limits in Excel, follow these steps:

- Select the entire table
- Click on the "Home" tab and click "Conditional Formatting"
- From the dropdown, choose "New Rule"
- Set up two rules: one for "under control" and one for "out of control"

Let’s start with the "under control" tablets...

## Under Control

Select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format" and follow this example:

## Out of Control

For tablets that are "out of control", follow the same steps and apply this rule:

# Exercise 1

In the workbook attached on Lea, in the exercise 1 tab, complete the following:

- Highlight all tablets that are "under control" in green
- Highlight all tablets that are "out of control" in red
