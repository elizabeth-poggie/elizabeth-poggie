# Conditional Formatting

We don't need to create a control chart to determine which tablets are in good condition and which ones are defective. Instead, we can use conditional formatting to highlight this information.

## How?

Let's go back to this diagram.

![demo](./assets/1.png)

A tablet that is "under control" will have a value between between `average - 1 sigma` AND `average + 1 sigma`

A tablet that is "out of control" will have a value between `average - 3 sigma` OR `average + 3 sigma`

## What does this look like in Excel?

Let's take the following statement that describes whether a tables is "in control":

```text
thickness >= average - 1 sigma

AND

thickness <= average + 1 sigma
```

And transfer this to the simpler Excel function:

```excel
=AND($B2>=$D2, $B2<=$C2)
```

The same logic applies to the defect statement:

```text
thickness < average - 3 sigma

OR

thickness > average + 3 sigma
```

Which just as easily can be described in Excel with this:

```excel
=OR($B2>$G2, $B2<$H2)
```

## Where does conditional formatting come in?
