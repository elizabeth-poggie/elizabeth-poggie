# Why learn it?

Usually what happens when you progress in your career, you get rewarded with higher pay and excel spreadsheets. Although it might be a bit dry at times, understanding this tool now will set you up for success in the long run.

# Recap

## Functions

Excel has a lot of functions, you could use your mouse to click or you could simply type `=` followed by the first few letters of the equation you want to do.

## Cell References

Why are there dollar signs around some cell references and not others? Or in other words, what is the difference between Relative and Absolute references?

## Relative Referencing

When you copy a formula with relative references to another cell, Excel adjusts the cell references based on the relative position of the new cell.

## Absolute Referencing

Remains fixed when you copy a formula

## Locking

However, if you choose to not put dollar signs next to a particular column or row to "lock it in place", you will get the following unexpected behavior

## Lazy Dollars Signs

To add dollar signs without needing to manually click, when u select the cell you are interested in, tap `f4` on Windows or `fn+f4` on Mac to toggle `$` signs

# Exercise 1

I'm attaching a somewhat rough Excel sheet that shows the distribution of global audiences for Instagram and Facebook in 2024, organized by age group. Your job is to make the following updates:

- Add the Instagram user data using relative references.
- Add the Facebook user data using relative references.
- Format the table to improve readability, using text and cell styling for better presentation.
- Adjust the numbers so they are displayed as percentages, with 1 decimal place for accuracy.
