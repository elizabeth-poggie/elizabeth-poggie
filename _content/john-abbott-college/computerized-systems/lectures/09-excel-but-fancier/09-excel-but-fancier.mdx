# Recap

## Functions

Excel has a lot of functions, you could use your mouse to click or you could simply type `=` followed by the first few letters of the equation you want to do.

## Cell References

Why are there dollar signs around some cell references and not others? Or in other words, what is the difference between Relative and Absolute references?

- Dollar signs / Absolute Referencing ðŸ‘‰ Remains fixed when you copy a formula
