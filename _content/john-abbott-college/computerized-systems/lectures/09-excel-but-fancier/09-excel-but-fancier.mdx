# Why learn it?

Usually what happens when you progress in your career, you get rewarded with higher pay and excel spreadsheets. Although it might be a bit dry at times, understanding this tool now will set you up for success in the long run.

# Recap

## Functions

Excel has a lot of functions, you could use your mouse to click or you could simply type `=` followed by the first few letters of the equation you want to do.

## Cell References

Why are there dollar signs around some cell references and not others? Or in other words, what is the difference between Relative and Absolute references?

## Relative Referencing

When you copy a formula with relative references to another cell, Excel adjusts the cell references based on the relative position of the new cell.

## Absolute Referencing

Remains fixed when you copy a formula

## Locking

However, if you choose to not put dollar signs next to a particular column or row to "lock it in place", you will get the following unexpected behavior

## Lazy Dollars Signs

To add dollar signs without needing to manually click, when u select the cell you are interested in, tap `f4` on Windows or `fn+f4` on Mac to toggle `$` signs

# Custom Style Formatting

Basic formatting will improve the readability of your workbook

## Text Styling

A lot of what you can do in word, you can also in Excel.

- Font Size
- Colors
- Text Alignment

## Cell Styling

To make your charts and tables easier to read, you can change the following:

- Borders
- Fill

# Custom Number Formatting

Excel let's you customize the following types of data:

- $
- %
- Dates
- Times
- Fractions
- ...and so much more

## How?

- Highlight the cells you want format
- Right click the highlight and select `Format Cells`
- This should open up a new view where you can now select

# Exercise 1

I'm attaching a somewhat rough Excel sheet that shows the distribution of global audiences for Instagram and Facebook in 2024, organized by age group. Your job is to make the following updates:

- Add the Instagram user data using relative references.
- Add the Facebook user data using relative references.
- Format the table to improve readability, using text and cell styling for better presentation.
- Adjust the numbers so they are displayed as percentages, with 1 decimal place for accuracy.

# Standard Deviation

When measuring things we can often notice trends and patterns.

When naturally occurring measurements happens mostly around one central value, we can measure how spread out values are from this central "peak".

## What is it?

Standard deviation is a measure of spread around a central value. In other words, it is a "distance" from an average value.

## What do big and small numbers mean?

- Low means that the data is clustered around the average
- High means that the data is WIDE

## Why do we need to know this?

We want to determine if any one value in our dataset is part of the expected variation or significantly significant.

## Standard Deviation in Excel

Yesterday you might have noticed that excel has multiple built-in equations for calculating the standard deviation. What's the difference?

- **STDEV.P** - Standard Deviation on a Population
  - Used when every single element is included in your data
    - Eg. Stats Canada census since everyone has to do it.
- **STDEV.S** - Standard Deviation on a Sample
  - Used when you only have data for a sub-set of total data.
    - Eg. Taking a few tables from a production line.

Most of the time we are working with Standard Deviation on a _sample_ since we rarely have access to the entire data set.

# Charts

## Types

Excel has several types of charts, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your data.

## Creating a Chart

- Select data for the chart (including headers)
- Select Insert > Recommended Charts
- Pick your fav
- Select a chart
- Select OK

# Trends

## Why use them?

Trendlines in Excel are used to visually represent patterns or trends in your data, making it easier to understand the underlying relationships and predict future values

## Creating a Trendline

- Select a chart.
- Select Chart Design > Add Chart Element.
- Select Trendline and then select the type of trendline you want, such as Linear, Exponential, Linear Forecast, or Moving Average.

# Exercise 2

Building on your first exercise, please apply the following updates:

- Calculate the standard deviation for the distribution of global audiences. What do these numbers tell you?
- Create a chart for the data and format the styles
- Add trendlines for the user distributions of both Facebook and Instagram.
