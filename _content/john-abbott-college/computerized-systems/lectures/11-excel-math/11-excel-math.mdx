## Scatter Charts

Scatter charts provide a straightforward way to explore and understand the relationship between data points, which is why they are commonly used as a default choice for data visualization.

## Combo Charts

In most cases, we want to compare the relationship between two sets of data, and this chart type makes that easy. The only catch is that the two sets of data need to have an overlapping x-axis.

## How can you make your combo charts cuter?

`Quick Layouts` and `Add Chart Element` will be your best friend :)

# Equations

In a previous lecture, we covered trendlines. Let's take it a step further. Once a trendline is added, you can extract the equation of that line. These values allow for deeper analysis, allowing more precise insights from your data set.

## How do we create an equation?

If the _slope_ and the _y-intercept_ are known, we can determine the corresponding Y value for any given X, and vice versa. By plugging in the values, we can easily predict points along the line, making it a common tool for data analysis.

# Equations in Excel

There are two ways of extracting the equations of a line from plotted data in Excel:

- Display the equation on the graph and manually write down the slope and Y-intercept constants.
- Use the built-in `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` functions (preferred method)

You can refer to [here](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2019/01/16/excel-trendline-types-equations-formulas/) for step by step instructions :)

# Exercise 1

- Using the sheet **Absorbance** create a Scatter chart and add a trendline to it.
- Extract the slope and the y-intercept and recreate the equation of a line.
- Using this new equation, find what would be the concentrations associated with the following absorbances:
  - 0.17
  - 0.11
  - 0.32

# Area Under a Curve

There are many situations were the Area Under a Curve (AUC) can provide additional information about the data.

## Why calculate it?

This happens because **the area under a curve has a mathematical relationship with the curve**. [See Introduction to Integration for more info.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-introduction.html)

## What does this mean for you?

In the field of [pharmacokinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics), the **area under the curve** (**AUC**) describes the variation of a drug [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration) in [blood plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma) as a function of time.

## What does this mean in the real world?

In practice, the drug concentration is measured at certain points and the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)(rectangular approximation) is used to estimate AUC.

## What does this mean for professionals in your industry?

This area under the curve is dependant on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the dose administered.

## What's the math

You can refer to [Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_under_the_curve_%28pharmacokinetics%29) for the detailed mathematical explanation

# AUC in Excel

We can use Excel to calculate the area under a curve. To do this we use the following approximation:

- Breakdown the area under a curve into small rectangles using the trapezoidal rule since the area of a rectangle is easier to calculate.
- Sum the area of all the rectangles to get the total area.

## The rule

The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function as a trapezoid and calculating its area.

## The rule in simple terms

- Instead of trying to calculate the area under the entire curve at once, we break it into smaller pieces between two points. Each piece is shaped like a trapezoid
- To find the area of each trapezoid, we take the average of the two heights (the values at two consecutive points) and multiply by the width.
- After calculating the area for each trapezoid, you simply add them up.

## Exercise 2

In Excel we will calculate ùö´x and ùö´y and then multiply them together to get the area of each rectangle. By the end of it, your equation should look something like this:

```md
| Time (hours) | Concentration (mg/L) | AUC Calculation     |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0            | 0                    | 0                   |
| 1            | 5.2                  | =(B2+B3)/2\*(A3-A2) |
| 2            | 8.0                  | =(B3+B4)/2\*(A4-A3) |
| ...          | ...                  | ...                 |
|              |                      | =sum(C2:C??)        |
```
