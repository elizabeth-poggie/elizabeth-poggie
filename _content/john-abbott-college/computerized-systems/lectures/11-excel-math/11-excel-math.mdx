## Scatter Charts

Scatter charts provide a straightforward way to explore and understand the relationship between data points, which is why they are commonly used as a default choice for data visualization.

## Combo Charts

In most cases, we want to compare the relationship between two sets of data, and this chart type makes that easy. The only catch is that the two sets of data need to have an overlapping x-axis.

## How can you make your combo charts cuter?

`Quick Layouts` and `Add Chart Element` will be your best friend :)

# Equations

In a previous lecture, we covered trendlines. Let's take it a step further. Once a trendline is added, you can extract the equation of that line. These values allow for deeper analysis, allowing more precise insights from your data set.

## How do we create an equation?

If the _slope_ and the _y-intercept_ are known, we can determine the corresponding Y value for any given X, and vice versa. By plugging in the values, we can easily predict points along the line, making it a common tool for data analysis.

## How do we create an equation with Excel?

There are two ways of extracting the equations of a line from plotted data in Excel:

- Display the equation on the graph and manually write down the slope and Y-intercept constants.
- Use the built-in `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` functions (preferred method)

You can refer to [here](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2019/01/16/excel-trendline-types-equations-formulas/) for step by step instructions :)

# Exercise 1

- Using the sheet **Absorbance** create a Scatter chart and add a trendline to it.
- Extract the slope and the y-intercept and recreate the equation of a line.
- Using this new equation, find what would be the concentrations associated with the following absorbances:
  - 0.17
  - 0.11
  - 0.32
