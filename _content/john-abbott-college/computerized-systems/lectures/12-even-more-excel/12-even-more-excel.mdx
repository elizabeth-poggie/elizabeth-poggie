# Recap

## Displaying Equations

Using trendlines, you can display the equation on the graph:

## Creating Equations

You can also use the built-in `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` functions in excel:

This is the preferred method because now we can easily plug in values to predict other points along the line:

## AUC Applications

The Area Under a Curve (AUC) helps determine how long a drug stays in the body and at what concentration. The higher the AUC, the greater the exposure to the drug.

## AUC in Math

To estimate the AUC from these measurements, they often use the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) (rectangular approximation). To break this down into simple steps:

- Split the curve into smaller triangles between two points.
- To calculate the area of each triangle.
- Once you have the areas of ALL triangles, just add them together to get the total area under the curve.

## AUC in Excel

Implementing the above approach in excel is relatively chill:
