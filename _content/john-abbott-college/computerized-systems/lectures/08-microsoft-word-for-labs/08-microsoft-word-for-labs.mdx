# Spreadsheet Programs

## What is it?

Exactly what you think it is, a giant grid of columns and rows.

## What are some examples?

- Microsoft Excel
- Google Sheets
- Apple Numbers
- ... and more

For the purposes of this class we will be focusing on excel, however a lot of the logic covered for this product is applicable for all spreadsheet software.

# Excel

## Who uses Excel?

Its one of the most popular tools on the planet. The application has about 750,000,000 million users worldwide and is present in almost every company that exists.

## Why is it so popular?

It makes it really easy to analyze large sets of data.

## How do you get started?

Open up excel and let's get started. We will explore it together.

# Overview

## Workbooks

A workbook is the entire Excel file that can contain multiple sheets (or tabs). Each workbook can be saved independently.

## Worksheet (Tab)

Each workbook consists of one or more worksheets, often referred to as tabs. Each worksheet contains a grid of cells where data is entered.

## Rows & Columns

Rows run horizontally and are numbered (e.g. 1,2,3), while columns run vertically and are labeled with letters (e.g. A, B, C)

## Cell

Cells are the basic units of a worksheet, organized into a grid of rows and columns. Each cell is identified by its _cell reference_, which combines the column letter and row number. (e.g. C3)

## Formula Bar

When you select a cell, the formula bar shows the contents of that cell. It may contain contents such as:

- Text, numbers, data
- Formulas
- Functions

## Ranges

A range is a selection of two or more cells. You can refer to a range using the starting cell and the ending cell. Ranges can be for specific columns or for a combination of many many columns.

# Functions

When we work with excel, we love to use functions.

## Inserting Functions

First, select the cell you would like to modify. Next, navigate to the formulas tab and select "Insert Function", this should open up a formula builder to help you get started.

You will notice that once you select "Insert Function", its auto-magically inserts an `=` sign. This is because when you start remembering all these function by heart, you can just enter that to insert.

For our functions, we can insert a number or a _cell reference_

# Demo 1

Let's compute the following in excel given a data set of the instagram accounts with the most followers in 2024:

- `=AVERAGE()`
- `=MIN()`
- `=MAX()`
- `=STDEV()`

# Exercise 1

Now it's your turn. Download the excel sheet on Lea. This contains the box office figures for the highest grossing movies each year, from 1915 to 2022.

# Cell References

You will be using this a lot.

## Overview

There are two types of cell references: relative and absolute. Relative and absolute references behave differently when copied and filled to other cells. Relative references change when a formula is copied to another cell. Absolute references, on the other hand, remain constant no matter where they are copied.

## Relative References

By default, all cell references are relative references. When copied across multiple cells, they change based on the relative position of rows and columns. For example, let's say we create the following formula in cell C1 of the first row:

```text
=A1+B1
```

When we copy row 1 to row 2, the formula will now become:

```text
 =A2+B2
```

This tends to be most handy when we need to repeat the same calculation across multiple rows or columns.

## Absolute references

There may be a time when you don't want a cell reference to change when copied to other cells. Unlike relative references, absolute references do not change when copied or filled. There have 3 general forms:

- `$A$2` ðŸ‘‰ The column and the row do not change when copied
- `A$2` ðŸ‘‰ The row does not change when copied
- `$A2` ðŸ‘‰ The column does not change when copied

In Excel, when we add a `$` symbol next to part of the cell reference, that is the part that is remaining constant.

## Sheet References

Excel allows you to refer to any cell on any worksheet. To do this, you'll simply need to begin the cell reference with the _worksheet name_ followed by an exclamation point (!). For example:

```text
'Worksheet Name'!A1
```

The above references a cell A1 on Sheet named "Worksheet Name"

# Demo 2

Let's say we have a bunch of students and we need to calculate their final grade. How do we do that?

```text
Final Grade = Total - (Number of mistakes * Penalty per mistake)
```

However what happens if we want to factor in the late penalty? Then the equation would look more like:

```text
Final Grade = (Total - Number of mistakes * Penalty per mistake) * (1 -  Number of days late * late penalty)
```

# Exercise 2

To get started, download the excel sheet on Lea. This contains a list of the 20 richest people in the United States in 2024. For this exercise you will be estimating their net income after taxes and hydro.
