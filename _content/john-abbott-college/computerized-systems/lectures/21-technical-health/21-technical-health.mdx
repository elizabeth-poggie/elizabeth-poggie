The term "phishing" comes from the idea of "fishing" for information by luring victims with a bait. What's the bait? Usually a fake website or email that look like legitimate source you are familiar with.

## How it works

- Step 1) The Bait ðŸ‘‰ A fake message or website that looks legitimate
- Step 2) The Hook ðŸ‘‰ You are encouraged to click on a link or download an attachment
- Step 3) The Catch ðŸ‘‰ All information entered is to later be used against you :^)

## Types of Phishing

- Email ðŸ‘‰ The most common.
  - _"Your Netflix subscription is about to expire. Update your payment details now."_
  - _"Unusual login detected on your account. Update your account details."_
- Spear ðŸ‘‰ Similar to email however the messages are more personalized to add to it's credibility.
  - _"Hi [Your Name], hereâ€™s the invoice you requested."_
  - _"Hi [Your Name], I came across your LinkedIn profile and saw that youâ€™re working at [Your Company]. Iâ€™m sharing a file with some insights on your industry. Hope it helps!"_
- Smishing ðŸ‘‰ Same vibe as email phishing, except this time it is through SMS/text messages.
  - _"Your package is delayed. Click here to confirm your address."_
  - _"Your [Bank Name] account is locked due to suspicious activity. Click here to verify your identity: [stinky link]."_
  - _"Weâ€™re hiring for a remote position! Get started today by filling out your application: [stinky link]."_
- Vishing ðŸ‘‰ Getting calls with someone role playing a trusted organization
  - _"This is your bank. We noticed suspicious activity on your account. Please verify your PIN"_
  - _"This is the IRS (or CRA). You have unpaid taxes, and a warrant will be issued unless you pay immediately via a wire transfer."_
  - _"Weâ€™re collecting funds for disaster relief in [specific location]. Would you like to donate? Please provide your credit card information."_
  - _"Hi, this is [Your Bossâ€™s Name]. Iâ€™m in a meeting and need you to quickly purchase gift cards for a client. Send the codes to my email ASAP."_
- Cloning ðŸ‘‰ A legitimate email youâ€™ve received gets copied and is resent with malicious links or attachments.

## Protecting yourself

What can you do to protect yourself?

- Inspect Links ðŸ‘‰ Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL. Does the link look like trash?
- Use Security Tools ðŸ‘‰ Install antivirus software and spam filters.
- Two FA ðŸ‘‰ Even if a someone gets your password, they can't access your account without the second authentication factor. (which is what JAC does lol)
