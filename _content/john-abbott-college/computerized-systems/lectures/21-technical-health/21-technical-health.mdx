# Phishing

Phishing is an attack where hackers trick people into sharing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or private personal details.

The term "phishing" comes from the idea of "fishing" for information by luring victims with a baitâ€”usually a fake but convincing message or website.

Hackers create fake websites or emails that look like legitimate platforms you are familiar with (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter).

## How it works

Victims are tricked into entering their login credentials on these fake pages.

## Example

You receive an email claiming "Unusual login detected on your account," prompting you to click a link that leads to a counterfeit login page.
