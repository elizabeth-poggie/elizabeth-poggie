The term "phishing" comes from the idea of "fishing" for information by luring victims with a bait. What's the bait? Usually a fake website or email that look like legitimate source you are familiar with.

## How it works

- Step 1) The Bait ðŸ‘‰ A fake message or website that looks legitimate
- Step 2) The Hook ðŸ‘‰ You are encouraged to click on a link or download an attachment
- Step 3) The Catch ðŸ‘‰ All information entered is to later be used against you :^)

## Types of Phishing

- Email ðŸ‘‰ The most common.
  - _"Your Netflix subscription is about to expire. Update your payment details now."_
  - _"Unusual login detected on your account. Update your account details."_
- Spear ðŸ‘‰ Similar to email however the messages are more personalized to add to it's credibility.
  - _"Hi [Your Name], hereâ€™s the invoice you requested."_
- Smishing ðŸ‘‰ Same vibe as email phishing, except this time it is through SMS/text messages.
  - _"Your package is delayed. Click here to confirm your address."_
- Vishing ðŸ‘‰ Getting calls with someone role playing a trusted organization
  - _"This is your bank. We noticed suspicious activity on your account. Please verify your PIN"_
- Cloning ðŸ‘‰ A legitimate email youâ€™ve received gets copied and is resent with malicious links or attachments.

## Vibe Check

Signs of a Phishing Attack
Urgency: "Act now or your account will be deactivated!"
Misspellings and Grammar Mistakes: Legitimate companies rarely make obvious mistakes.
Suspicious Links: Links that donâ€™t match the sender's real domain (e.g., "www.paypalsecurity.com" instead of "www.paypal.com").
Requests for Personal Information: Legitimate organizations rarely ask for sensitive details via email or text.

## Protecting yourself

Verify Messages: Double-check with the company through official channels (e.g., call the customer support number on their website).
Inspect Links: Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL.
Use Security Tools: Install antivirus software and spam filters.
Enable MFA: Even if a hacker gets your password, they can't access your account without the second authentication factor.
Stay Informed: Familiarize yourself with phishing techniques to recognize them.
