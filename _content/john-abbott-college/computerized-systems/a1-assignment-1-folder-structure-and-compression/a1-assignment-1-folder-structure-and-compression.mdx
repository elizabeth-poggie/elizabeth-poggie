- Organize the files into folders:
  - Create a main folder named `assignment_1`. This will be the top level folder for the rest of the assignment.
  - Create the folder structure shown below (only folders are shown).

```md
assignment-1
├── audio
├── documents
│ ├── pdfs

│ │ ├── other
├── images
├── videos
```

- Place files into their respective folders, according to their file type.
  - Pay attention to the file extensions to understand what kind of file you are dealing with.
  - If you see a file extension and you don’t know how to categorize it, Google it
- Look at the properties for the folders Audio, Documents, Images, and Videos, and record their folder size in mega-bytes (MB). You will need this information in Part 3 of the assignment.
