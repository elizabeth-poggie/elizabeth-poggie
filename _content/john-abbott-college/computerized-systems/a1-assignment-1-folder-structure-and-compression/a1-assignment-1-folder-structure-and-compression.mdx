# Part 1: Folder Structure & Compression

Please follow the instructions below to create the specified folder structure and categorize each file by placing it inside their respective category.

- Download the file `assignment_1_files.zip` from Lea.
- Extract the content of the `.zip` file in a location of your choice.
- Organize the files into folders:
  - Create a main folder named `assignment_1`. This will be the top level folder for the rest of the assignment.
  - Create the folder structure shown below (only folders are shown).

```md
assignment-1
├── audio
├── documents
│ ├── pdfs
│ ├── spreadsheets
│ ├── text
│ │ ├── word-documents
│ │ ├── other
├── images
├── videos
```

- Place files into their respective folders, according to their file type.
  - Pay attention to the file extensions to understand what kind of file you are dealing with.
  - If you see a file extension and you don’t know how to categorize it, Google it
- Look at the properties for the folders Audio, Documents, Images, and Videos, and record their folder size in mega-bytes (MB). You will need this information in Part 3 of the assignment.

# Part 2 - Creating New Files

In this section you will create two files and place them in the top-level folder.

- Create a Microsoft Word document, write your name inside it.
- Save it as the name Compression `Ratios.docx` and place it inside the correct folder.
- Create an empty Microsoft Excel document.
- Save it as the name `Excel1.xlsx` and place it inside the correct folder.

# Part 3 - Word

In this section you will use the information collected in Step 1 to display the relative compression of each folder using a table in Word.

- Open the Word file Compression Ratios.docx that you created in Part 2.
- Insert a table with four columns. Column names are the following:

  - _Folder Name_ (this is the name of your folder)
  - _Size Before_ (folder size before compression, taking from Part 1)
  - _Size After_ (folder size after compression, taken from Part 1)
  - _Relative Compression_ (a number that you will calculate below)

- For each folder you compressed in Part 1 (see steps 5 and 6), populate their information in a new row under each respective column header.
  - The relative size compression is how much the folder size changed after compression when compared to the original size.
  - To calculate this, divide the final size (after compression) by the original size (before compression).

```text
Relative Compression = ( final size )/( original size )
```

- Highlight the folder with the best compression in green (compressed the most)
- Highlight the folder with the worst compression in orange (did not shrink much or at all).

# Submission

- Compress the top level folder Assignment_1 (which contains all your work).
- Place the folder on OneDrive and share with me
- upload it to Lea under `Assignment #1`
