# Overview

Created by Salim ATTOU, Director of Engineering & Infrastructure for industry professionals, and adapted for the educational setting. The goal is to bridge the gap from classroom to desk, setting students up for success in their future careers, whether that be in higher education or the corporate world.

# Meets Requirements

The task meets all specified requirements as outlined in the given instructions.

## Considerations:

- Have you integrated prior task feedback and class discussions into your code?
- Have you thoroughly reviewed all the task details before your final submission to ensure compliance with requirements?
- Have you clarified any ambiguities or uncertainties regarding the task requirements before proceeding with your submission?

## Anti-pattern:

- You submit an an incomplete solution

# Code Quality

This aspect evaluates the overall quality of the code. High-quality code should be well-structured and easy to understand.

## Considerations:

- Are variable names descriptive and meaningful?
- Are error handling mechanisms informative, providing meaningful feedback to users?
- If modularization is possible, is it implemented effectively, ensuring clear separation of concerns?
- If a design pattern can be leveraged, is it applied correctly and in alignment with the intended use case?

## Anti-pattern:

- Submitting unreadable and not well documented code that crashes on error.

# Best Practices

The code follows established coding conventions and standards, promoting scalability, reliability, and maintainability over time.

## Considerations:

- Are variable names consistently written in `camelCase` format?
- Does the code maintain consistent indentation and formatting throughout?
- Are comments used effectively to explain complex sections of code or document important decisions?

## Anti-pattern:

- The code does not incorporate any of the material covered in class.

# Logic

The code logic should be clear, concise, and logically sound to ensure proper functioning with minimal complexity. You do more with less.

## Considerations:

- Have you optimized your solution to be as simple as possible while still meeting requirements?
- Can any parts of the code be made more concise without sacrificing functionality or readability?

## Anti-pattern:

- Proposes impractical or over-engineered solutions that do not meet task requirements

# Bugs

There are no additional defects, errors, or issues present in the code.

## Considerations:

- Have you tested your solution, including edge cases, to ensure the program doesn't crash?
- If your solution involves user interaction, have you implemented input validation?

## Anti-pattern:

- The code crashes on edge cases and does not provide effective error handling

# Timely Submission

Ensures punctual submissions.

## Considerations:

- Demonstrates awareness of when to seek guidance on tasks, allowing ample time before the deadline.
- Communicates any personal circumstances preventing timely submission.
- Successfully prioritizes tasks, allocating appropriate time to major components versus minor details.
- Avoids scope creep to adhere to deadlines; while creativity is valued, it should not impede timely submission.

## Anti-pattern:

- Repeatedly misses deadlines
- Fails to proactively communicate obstacles

# Creativity Bonus

The code takes an innovative and original approach.

## Considerations:

- Was your problem-solving approach unconventional?
- Did you incorporate your own touch into the solution, such as creating a unique interface design or developing your own algorithm?
- Did you add any additional features to your solution that enhances the user experience?

## Anti-pattern:

- Fulfills the minimum requirements without innovation or originality.
- Demonstrates a reluctance to explore new ideas or take calculated risks in problem-solving.
- Fails to incorporate diverse perspectives or consider alternative methods, resulting in stagnation.

# Leadership Bonus

Demonstrates leadership skills:

- Ownership - Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire group, beyond just their own circle.
- Frugality - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
- Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
- Have Backbone - Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
- Invent and Simplify - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- Are Right, A Lot - Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
- Learn and Be Curious - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
- Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- Think Big - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
- ... and more. These are just a few examples.

## Considerations:

- Demonstrates understanding of tasks by asking clarifying questions.
- Respectfully challenges decisions in instances of disagreement.
- Consistently supports the success of peers through coaching or mentoring. (not by copy and pasting solutions tho lol, that's plagiarism)
- Enhances the class experience by identifying and suggesting improvements.
- In group activities, you are the go to person to communicate the work to the class.

## Anti-pattern:

- Cheats, plagiarizes, and frequently skips classes.
- Does not accept feedback from their peers or the prof.
- Actively promotes a negative outlook for the class or alienates individuals without offering constructive solutions.
- Avoids taking responsibility for actions, errors, or setbacks, deflecting blame onto others or external factors.
