# Question 1

Which of these behaviors would constitute cheating or plagiarism when working on Assignment 1 for this course? üëÄ

- ‚ùå Telling your friend to Google JavaScript function syntax when they tell you they are stuck.
- ‚ùå Convincing your classmates that 'paper, scissors, rock' does sound better than the wrong version.
- ‚úÖ Group programming with a class mate or two.
- ‚úÖ Asking your granny, a JavaScript expert, to do your assignment, promising video call minutes in exchange.
- ‚úÖ Screen sharing to show your friend what you did for the second function.
- ‚úÖ Sending a friend part of your assignment code for inspiration.

## Why?

Guiding someone to find information independently helps them learn and understand the material better and suggesting a bad solution over the wrong solution does not involve cheating or plagiarism, it's more about preferences.

# Question 2

Select the best JavaScript Object that represents a student. The only correct answer is:

```js
const student = {
  firstName: "Arthur",
  lastName: "Dent",
  id: 42,
  courses: ["Web 1", "Databases", "Programming 3"],
  contactInfo: {
    email: "42@johnabbott.net",
    mobile: "(424) 242-4242",
  },
  introduce: function () {
    return `Hi, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};
```

## Why?

All other options contain a formatting error or the improper type for the given property.
