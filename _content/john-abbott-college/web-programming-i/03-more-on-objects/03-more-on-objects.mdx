# Polling Recap

## How would you rate your current understanding of JavaScript?

Most people scored between 1 - 4. Beyond what we discussed last class, what do you remember about JavaScript and programming in general?

## What are your weekdays like?

Around 80% of people have a full-time school load and 95% of you are juggling this class with other major responsabilities outside the classroom. To respect these commitments, part of your class period will be dedicated to assignment work. I will run these periods similar to the experience in industry where I walk around the class to answer your questions while you develop your features.

## How would you describe your computer resources at home?

Around of 90% of students have a good personal laptop at home. The remaining 10%, don't worry about it cause I will make sure you get a lot of time in class to do your work.

## How do you prefer to learn and receive instruction?

We have a pretty consistent >45% for Lectures, Group Work, and Exercises with Hands on practice topping the charts at 75% closely followed by Notes at 70%. Suplimentary reading material and videos seemed deeply un-popular with slides being a controversial choice however for our visual learners i'll try to make sure there is some visual content to make up for the decision to not heavily rely on slides. For now, I will make sure images are really included in my notes to make up for this decision.

## Anything else you would like me to know?

Thank you for the kind comments from the google form and evals from last semester. Looking forward to having you all as students and as a teacher i don't really see the impact i have on y'all but it made my year going from the court of performance evals in the court of coprorate to y'alls feedback. If anything it helped me decide to stick to my current career as a teacher for atleast the next few years before I try something new.

For the first time in my career i can genuinly say I am looking forward to working with you all this upcoming semester and please never hestitate to pitch any ideas for improvement for the class :) I want y'all to suceed.

## Evaluations for you

I posted the assignment rubric on my website. I don't actually fully grade your assignments myself as I am in the process of partially automating it. I am a human and miss things and want to ensure all students are graded equally and ensure that if i catch a mistake on one students assignment, it's accounted for alkl student assignments. I trust a robot to not miss that sort of stuff better than me. Consquently, if my bot or I manage to catch something on one students assignment and not another, please send me eiher a personal MIO or submit a bug report on GitHub Issues once I make the repo public so I can fix it.

# JavaScript Homework Recap

Why was ECMAScript 5 considered the rebirth of JavaScript?

When was the latest version of JavaScript released? What is its official name?

Write a nested loop in JavaScript that prints out all the different seat combinations in a theater. Theater seats often display a row and seat number to help theatergoers find their seats. If there are 26 rows (0 to 25) and 100 seats (0 to 99) in each row, then some of the potential combinations are listed below:

```text
0-0
0-1
0-2
...
25-97
25-98
25-99
```
