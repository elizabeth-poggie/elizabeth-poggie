# Stepping Back

From last class the syntax might seem intimidating, but donâ€™t worry. Weâ€™re going to take a step back and break it down, gradually building up to that example. Remember, JavaScript involves a lot of trial and error, and each of you will develop your own unique style as you go. Last class, I saw ten different solutions to Exercise 0 and even more for Exercise 1. Just like writing an English essay, youâ€™ll find your own voice in coding.

In the beginning, youâ€™ll write plenty of code that doesnâ€™t work, but through debugging and tweaking, youâ€™ll start to get a real feel for the language. Itâ€™s something that comes with experience, and youâ€™ll notice that even among your peers, there will be a lot of different approaches to solving the same problem.

# Types

What are some examples of types you see in your other languages? You will notice there is a lot of overlap between JavaScript and other languages, however the key ones of JavaScript are:

- `undefined` ðŸ‘‰ means lack of existence. The use of `undefined` tends to be reserved for the JavaScript Engine
- `null` ðŸ‘‰ also means lack of existence. Can be assigned to variables by developers
- `boolean` ðŸ‘‰ `true` and `false`
- `number` ðŸ‘‰ The only number type available.
- `string` ðŸ‘‰ A sequence of characters
- ... and a few others outside the scope of the class.

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variables can hold any type of data, and the type can change at runtime. Well what does this really mean?

## No Type Declaration

When you declare a variable in JavaScript using `var`, `let`, or `const`, you donâ€™t need to specify its type. The type is inferred from the value you assign.

```js
let myVariable = 42; // myVariable is a Number
```

## Types Can Change

You can reassign a variable to a value of a different type without any issues.

```js
let myVariable = 42; // myVariable is a Number
myVariable = "hello"; // now it's a String
myVariable = true; // now it's a Boolean
myVariable = []; // now it's an Array
```

## Type Coercion

JavaScript automatically converts between types when it expects a different type. This is called type coercion.

```js
let myVariable = "5" + 3; // this is valid
let myVariable = 5 + "3"; // so is this
```

## Type Checking

Because types are determined at runtime, errors related to types might only show up when the code runs. To check the type of a variable you can run the following:

```js
console.log(typeof myVariable);
```

# Arrays

In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in JavaScript, allowing you to organize and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

## Array Creation

You've got several options

```js
let cats = ["Cute Cat", "Long Cat", "Cowboy Cat"]; // You can use the classic [] brackets
let nums = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4); // or use the Array constructor
```

## Indexing

Like the Arrays you have experienced in other languages, in JavaScript they are also zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.

```js
let cats = ["Cute Cat", "Long Cat", "Cowboy Cat"];
console.log(cats[0]);
```

## Dynamic Sizing

The behavior of an array in JavaScript acts very similarly to what you see in Lists for languages like C# and Java. What does this mean? JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning you can change their size by adding or removing elements. What does this look like?

```js
let cats = ["Cute Cat", "Long Cat", "Cowboy Cat"];
console.log(cats[0]);
```

## Array Methods

Many of the methods you've used with lists in other languages are available in JavaScript right out of the box.

```js
// You can add an item to the end of the array
cats.push("fat cat");
// ... or add multiple items
cats.push("one cat", "two cat");
// You can also remove the last item from an array
cats.pop();
// You can get the length of an array
let total = cats.length();
console.log(total);
// You can find the index of a specific item in the array
let index = cats.indexOf("Long Cat");
console.log(index);
```

Thereâ€™s plenty more to explore, but this should give you a solid introduction to what's available.

# Exercise 0

For the [Pen](https://codepen.io/elizabeth-poggie/pen/NWZzOQg?editors=0012) and implement the functions

## Solution

```js
const cats = [];

function addCat(cat) {
  cats.push(cat);
  console.log(`${cat} has been added.`);
  console.log("Current cats in the array:", cats);
}

function sellLastCat() {
  if (cats.length === 0) {
    console.log("No cats left to sell!");
  } else {
    const soldCat = cats.pop();
    console.log(`${soldCat} has been sold.`);
    console.log("Current cats in the array:", cats);
  }
}

function totalCats() {
  console.log(`Total number of cats: ${cats.length}`);
}

// Adding 4 Cats
addCat("Cute Cat");
addCat("Long Cat");
addCat("Cowboy Cat");
addCat("Chonky Cat");

sellLastCat(); // Selling Chonky Cat
sellLastCat(); // Selling Cowboy Cat

totalCats(); // Display the total remaining cats
```

# Variable Declaration

`let`, `const`, and `var` are all used to declare variables. Whats the difference? They have different behaviors and scopes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key differences:

## Var

`var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in. If declared outside a function, it is globally scoped.

```js
// a globally scoped variable
var x = 42;
function example() {
  // a locally scoped variable
  var y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 24
}
example();
console.log(x + " " + y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined. This means you can reference the variable before its declaration, although it will be undefined until the declaration line is reached.

```js
var x = 42;
function example() {
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 undefined
  var y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 24
}
example();
```

You can re-declare a variable using var without throwing an error.

```js
var x = 5;
var x = 42; // No error
console.log(b); // 42
```

## Let

`let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block ({}) in which it is declared.

```js
// a globally scoped variable
let x = 42;
function example() {
  // a locally scoped variable
  let y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 24
}
example();
console.log(x + " " + y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

Unlike `var`, it is not initialized with `undefined`. If you try to access it before its declaration, youâ€™ll get a ReferenceError.

```js
var x = 42;
function example() {
  console.log(x + " " + y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  var y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y);
}
example();
```

You cannot re-declare a variable with let in the same scope.

```js
let x = 5;
let x = 42; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
console.log(b); // 42
```

## Const

`let` and `const` share many similar behaviors with respect to scope:

```js
// a globally scoped variable
const x = 42;
function example() {
  // a locally scoped variable
  const y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 24
}
example();
console.log(x + " " + y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

`const` behaves similarly to `let` ff you try to access it before its declaration, youâ€™ll also get a ReferenceError.

```js
const x = 42;
function example() {
  console.log(x + " " + y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  const y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y);
}
example();
```

`const` is used to declare constants, meaning the value assigned to a `const` variable cannot be reassigned.

```js
const x = 42;
x = 24; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

Unless of course the constant is an object or array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be modified.

```js
const x = [];
x.push(42, "beep", false, ["boop", [99]]); // shockingly, this is legal
```

You cannot re-declare a variable with `const` in the same scope.

```js
const x = [];
const x = []; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared.
```

## Why are there so many choices?

Because JavaScript. All these options reflect the evolution of the language.

## When do I use what?

Best practice is to use `const` by default and `let` when you need to reassign. `var` tends to come in handy if you need function-scoped variables, though this is less common in modern JavaScript. Unfortunately, if you work with older software or legacy code developed over the past 30 years, you may still come across all these variable declaration options.

# Exercise 1

For the following Pen and Complete the following logic:

- Create an adoption center name, this shouldn't change over the course of your program
- Initialize a variable that represents the total number of adopted cats.
- Implement a function that simulates adopting a cat.

```js
const centerName = "Cute Cats Adoption Center";
let adoptedCats = 0;

function adoptCat() {
  adoptedCats++;
  console.log(`Total adopted cats: ${adoptedCats}`);
}
```

# Exercise 2

In this exercise, you'll manage a global array of cat names and use the `adoptCat()` function to randomly select a cat for adoption. This will help you understand variable scope and random selection in JavaScript.

What you will need to randomly select a cat:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * arrayLength);
```

## Solution

```js
const centerName = "Cute Cats Adoption Center";
let adoptedCats = 0;
const catNames = ["Cute Cat", "Long Cat", "Cowboy Cat", "Fat Cat", "Simba"];

function adoptCat() {
  adoptedCats++;

  // Randomly select a cat from the catNames array
  let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * catNames.length);
  let adoptedCat = catNames[randomIndex];

  // Log the adopted cat's name
  console.log(`Adopted cat: ${adoptedCat}`);
  console.log(`Total adopted cats: ${adoptedCats}`);
}
```
