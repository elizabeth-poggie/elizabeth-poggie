# Brief Recap

- JavaScript is dynamically typed and allows you to get away with a lot of shenanigans.
- `const` is the best, `let` for reassignment needs, and `var` is like the weird uncle you try to avoid at family gatherings. While you should understand how it works, it's best to be avoided.
- JavaScript objects are pretty cool and powerful. You can store a lot of neat things in them including related properties, methods (functions that belong to the object), and even other objects.
- Global variables are bad news and can cause problems down the line. Although it might seem like a minor decision, using global variables can quickly cause problems that affect your entire codebase. It's best to avoid them to prevent painful refactoring sessions and maintain cleaner, more manageable code.

TLDR: Good code starts with solid foundations.

# Functions that take objects

Let's start building on complexity and create a function that takes objects as parameters. we'll determine if SpongeBob passes his boating school based on his grades. We'll use an object to store SpongeBob's information, including his name and a list of his grades.

```js
// Step 1 üëâ create an object
const student = {
  name: "SpongeBob SquarePants",
  // Grades from different tests
  tests: [
    {
      grade: 40,
      feedback: ["Ran into the Krusty Krab"],
    },
    {
      grade: 35,
      feedback: ["Crashed the boat 5 times", "Inflated Mrs. Puff"],
    },
    {
      grade: 10,
      feedback: ["Classified as a public menace on the road."],
    },
  ],
  // The standards are high in Bikini Bottom
  passingGrade: 85,
};
```

Now we'll create a function to check if SpongeBob‚Äôs average grade is above the passing grade. If it is, he gets his license and graduates from boating school; otherwise, he does not.

```js
// Step 2 üëâ Function Declaration
function hasPassedBoatingSchool(student) {
  let total = 0;
  const numberOfGrades = student.tests.length;
  const allFeedback = [];

  // Calculate the total score
  for (let i = 0; i < student.tests.length; i++) {
    let test = student.tests[i];
    total += test.grade;
    allFeedback.push(test.feedback);
  }

  // Calculate the average score
  const averageGrade = total / numberOfGrades;

  // Determine if the student passes and provide feedback if not
  if (averageGrade >= student.passingGrade) {
    return `${student.name} has graduated üßë‚Äçüéì`;
  } else {
    return `
        ${
          student.name
        } has not passed boating school. Please see the below feedback: \n ${allFeedback.toString()}
    `;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `hasPassedBoatingSchool` function takes a student object as a parameter, calculates the average of the grades, and checks if it meets or exceeds the passing grade. If the student does not pass boating school it outputs a result explaining what the student needs to work on to improve.

_Example Usage:_

```js
const feedback = hasPassedBoatingSchool(student);
console.log(feedback);
```

_Expected Output:_

```text
SpongeBob SquarePants has not passed boating school. Please see the below feedback:
Ran into the Krusty Krab,Crashed the boat 5 times,Inflated Mrs. Puff,Classified as a public menace on the road.
```

The function is generic, and can be used with other student objects with the same structure. For example, if we create another student object with similar properties, we can use the function to evaluate this new student as well:

```js
const student2 = {
  name: "Patrick Star",
  // Grades from different tests
  tests: [
    {
      grade: 100,
      feedback: ["Perfect Run."],
    },
    {
      grade: 95,
      feedback: ["Perfect.", "Such a smooth ride"],
    },
  ],
  // The standards are high in Bikini Bottom
  passingGrade: 85,
};

const feedback2 = hasPassedBoatingSchool(student2);
console.log(feedback2);
```

_Expected Output:_

```text
Patrick Star has graduated üßë‚Äçüéì
```

And just like that, we're using our knowledge of objects to write cleaner, more effective JavaScript code :^)

# Exercise 1

Create a function to determine if a user is eligible for a discount based on their purchase history. Use an object to store the user's information, including their name, the amount of their purchases, and their membership status.

## Part A - Object Spec

Use an object to store the user's information, including their name, the amount of their purchases, their membership status, and the minimum amount required for a discount. Their purchases should be stored as an array of objects with the following properties:

```js
{
    amount: 650,
    item: "Laptop",
}
```

## Part B - Function Spec

Create a function to check if the user is eligible for a discount. If the total amount of their purchases meets or exceeds the minimum amount required and they are a premium member, they get a discount. Otherwise, they do not.

## Solution

```js
// Step 1 üëâ Create an object
const user = {
  name: "Arthur Dent",
  purchases: [
    {
      amount: 650,
      item: "Laptop",
    },
    {
      amount: 50,
      item: "Mouse",
    },
    {
      amount: 200,
      item: "Monitor",
    },
  ],
  isPremiumMember: true,
  minimumAmountForDiscount: 500,
};

// Step 2 üëâ Function Declaration
function hasDiscountEligibility(user) {
  let totalSpent = 0;

  // Calculate the total amount spent
  for (let i = 0; i < user.purchases.length; i++) {
    let purchase = user.purchases[i];
    totalSpent += purchase.amount;
  }

  // Determine if the user is eligible for a discount
  if (totalSpent >= user.minimumAmountForDiscount && user.isPremiumMember) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

// Step 3 üëâ Example IO
console.log(hasDiscountEligibility(user)); // true
```

# Arrays continued

Going back to what we know about arrays, these are the functions we know so far:

```js
// Add a single item to the end of an array
myArray.push(item);
// Add multiple items to the end of an array
myArray.push(item1, item2);
// Remove the last item from an array
myArray.pop();
// Get the length of an array
myArray.length;
// Find the index of a specific item in the array
myArray.indexOf(findItem);
```

These allow us to dynamically resize and search the array much like a list data structure that you are familiar with from previous classes. But there are a few more that are worth knowing...

## Splicing

```js
// You can get the length of an array
myArray.splice(removeFromIndex, removeNumberOfElements, replacement1, replacement2, ...);
```

With `splice`, you can remove one or more elements from an array at a specific index as opposed to `pop()` which only lets you modify at the very end. For example:

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
fruits.splice(1, 1);
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "cherry", "date"]
```

`splice` can also be used to insert new elements into an array at a specific index, effectively "`splice`ing" them into place. For example:

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "date"];
fruits.splice(1, 0, "banana");
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
```

## Iterating

The `forEach()` method iterates over the array without the need of an explicitly defined index. For example, going back to our boating school example, this is how we iterated over all the testing scores:

```js
// Traditional loop
for (let i = 0; i < student.tests.length; i++) {
  let test = student.tests[i];
  total += test.grade;
}
```

Alternatively, this can also be written like this:

```js
// Slightly fancier loops
for (let test of student.tests) {
  total += test.grade;
}
```

And using what we know about this `forEach()` method, we can do the following 1 liner:

```js
// Even fancier loops
student.tests.forEach(function (x) {
  total += test.grade;
});
```

And if anyone is curious about arrow notation, you can get this very sleek gentleman right here:

```js
// SLEEK loops üëå
student.tests.forEach((test) => {
  total += test.grade;
});
```

In summary:

- `forEach()` does not modify the original array
- `forEach()` returns nothing and therefore the return value is `undefined`

However, there is an even sleeker way you can iterate over the contents of a loop üëÄ
