# Brief Recap

- JavaScript is dynamically typed and allows you to get away with a lot of shenanigans.
- `const` is the best, `let` for reassignment needs, and `var` is like the weird uncle you try to avoid at family gatherings. While you should understand how it works, it's best to be avoided.
- JavaScript objects are pretty cool and powerful. You can store a lot of neat things in them including related properties, methods (functions that belong to the object), and even other objects.
- Global variables are bad news and can cause problems down the line. Although it might seem like a minor decision, using global variables can quickly cause problems that affect your entire codebase. It's best to avoid them to prevent painful refactoring sessions and maintain cleaner, more manageable code.

TLDR: Good code starts with solid foundations.

# Functions that take objects

Let's start building on complexity and create a function that takes objects as parameters.

Let’s create a function that determines if SpongeBob passes his boating school based on his grades. We’ll use an object to store SpongeBob’s information, including his name and a list of his grades.

```js
const student = {
  name: "SpongeBob SquarePants",
  // Grades from different tests
  tests: [
    {
      grade: 40,
      feedback: ["Ran into the Krusty Krab"],
    },
    {
      grade: 35,
      feedback: ["Crashed the boat 5 times", "Inflated Mrs. Puff"],
    },
    {
      grade: 10,
      feedback: ["Classified as a public menace on the road."],
    },
  ],
  // The standards are high in Bikini Bottom
  passingGrade: 85,
};
```

We want to create a function that checks if SpongeBob’s average grade is above the passing grade. If it is, he gets his license and graduates from boating school; otherwise, he does not.

```js
// Function Declaration
function hasPassedBoatingSchool(student) {
  let total = 0;
  const numberOfGrades = student.tests.length;
  const allFeedback = [];

  // Calculate the total score
  for (let test of student.tests) {
    total += test.grade;
    allFeedback.push(test.feedback);
  }

  // Calculate the average score
  const averageGrade = total / numberOfGrades;

  // Determine if the student passes and provide feedback if not
  if (averageGrade >= student.passingGrade) {
    return `${student.name} has graduated 🧑‍🎓`;
  } else {
    return `
        ${
          student.name
        } has not passed boating school. Please see the below feedback: \n ${allFeedback.toString()}
    `;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `hasPassedBoatingSchool` function takes a student object as a parameter, calculates the average of the grades, and checks if it meets or exceeds the passing grade. If the student does not pass boating school it outputs a result explaining what the student needs to work on to improve.

Example Usage:

```js
const feedback = hasPassedBoatingSchool(student);
console.log(feedback);
```

Expected Output:

```text
SpongeBob SquarePants has not passed boating school. Please see the below feedback:
Ran into the Krusty Krab,Crashed the boat 5 times,Inflated Mrs. Puff,Classified as a public menace on the road.
```

The function is generic, because let's say we create another object with the same properties, we can use the function to evaluate this other student as well:

```js
const student2 = {
  name: "Patrick Star",
  // Grades from different tests
  tests: [
    {
      grade: 100,
      feedback: ["Perfect Run."],
    },
    {
      grade: 95,
      feedback: ["Perfect.", "Such a smooth ride"],
    },
  ],
  // The standards are high in Bikini Bottom
  passingGrade: 85,
};

const feedback2 = hasPassedBoatingSchool(student2);
console.log(feedback2);
```

Which will give the following output:

```text
Patrick Star has graduated 🧑‍🎓
```
