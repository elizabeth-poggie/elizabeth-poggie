# Promise.all()

With traditional promises, sharing resolved values across multiple steps in the chain could be tricky. `async` and `await` simplifies that. HOWEVER, we still want to run multiple asynchronous tasks at the same time, _especially if they're not dependent on each other_. This is why we love `Promise.all`

## Common failures

Only await tasks sequentially if they depend on each other’s results. If they’re _independent_, you can use `Promise.all` to run them "concurrently" (e.g. at the same time)

For example, let's say I have the following `async` function:

```js
// simple function
const getIngredient = async (name) => {
  // walk to kitchen delay
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
  // return ingredient
  return Promise.resolve(name);
};
```

Now, here’s a function that uses this to make a sandwich:

```js
const badSandwich = async () => {
  const ing1 = await getIngredient("bread");
  const ing2 = await getIngredient("peanut butter");
  const ing3 = await getIngredient("jelly");
  return [ing1, ing2, ing3, ing1]; // 🥪
};
```

To make a sandwich:

```js
try {
  const food = await badSandwich();
  console.log(food);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message);
}
```

However, this is a `badSandwich` because each ingredient waits for the previous one. Let’s make a `betterSandwich` using `Promise.all`:

```js
const betterSandwich = async () => {
  const [ing1, ing2, ing3] = await Promise.all([
    getIngredient("bread"),
    getIngredient("peanut butter"),
    getIngredient("jelly"),
  ]);
  return [ing1, ing2, ing3, ing1]; // 🥪
};
```

Using `Promise.all` allows us to get each ingredient "concurrently", which makes the code faster and more efficient. In `betterSandwich` we’re taking full advantage of _non-blocking code_ and using the event loop effectively :^)

Why is this technique so handy? Let's take a look at the real world application

# Real World Application

Let's take what we know about `fetch`ing data from an API and do this elegantly with `async` and await

For example, let's `fetch` a bunch of pokemons concurrently with the following syntax:

```js
const urls = [
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/squirtle",
];

// Step 1 - create a bunch of pokemon promises
const pokemonPromises = urls.map(async (url) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  // I am returning a PROMISE of JSON not actually JSON
  return response.json();
});

// Step 2 - resolve promises all at once
console.log(await Promise.all(pokemonPromises));
```

## Alternative strategy

However let's say we wanted to fetch the data one at a time for various reasons. In this case, you need to be careful when you use `async` and `await` when working with `map` and `forEach`. It wont actually pause the function in this context:

```js
const pokemonPromises = urls.map(async (url) => {
  // not being paused like you may think
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.json();
});

// everything concurrently
console.log(await Promise.all(pokemonPromises));
```

Alternatively, if you want stuff to happen one at a time instead of concurrently, you can use the following syntax:

```js
const pokemons = [];

const pokemonLoop = async () => {
  // fetching one thing at a time
  for await (const url of urls) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const pokemon = await response.json();
    pokemons.push(pokemon);
  }
};

// resolve the loop
await pokemonLoop();

console.log(pokemons);
```

## (not so) Fun Fact

async/await is the industry standard :^)

# Exercise 1

Using what you know about `fetch`, try to call the Pokemon API to `fetch` 5 pokemon's `id` using the `async` / `await`, `Promise.all`, and this endpoint:

```text
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}
```

## Solution

```js
const pokemonNames = ["ditto", "pikachu", "squirtle", "charizard", "bulbasaur"];

// Create a generic fetch function for reusability
const fetchData = async (urls) => {
  return await Promise.all(
    urls.map(async (url) => {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      return response.json();
    })
  );
};

// create a function that wraps all our async code
const main = async () => {
  try {
    // step 1 - get the ids
    const pokemons = await fetchData(
      pokemonNames.map((name) => `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`)
    );
    // step 2 - extract ids
    const ids = pokemons.map((pokemon) => pokemon.id);

    console.log(ids);

    // log all the mapped information
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("TRASHHHHHHHH: ", error);
  }
};

main();
```

# Common Mistakes

## Not handling Errors

Wrap your stuff in a `try/catch` otherwise you will be at the mercy of code that "seems" to run and doesn't

```js
// Trash 🗑️
async function badGetData(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.json();
}

// Not Trash 💐
async function goodGetData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    return response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // if you are feeling spicy, you can use the error method:
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}
```

## Not returning Promises in Promise.all

Its important to resolve or reject all our promises as there is nothing worse then having untracked promises both IRL and in our code:

```js
// Trash 🗑️
const data = await Promise.all(
  urls.map(async (url) => {
    // This does not return the JSON tho
    await fetch(url);
  })
);

// Not Trash 💐
const data = await Promise.all(
  urls.map(async (url) => {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    // Return the JSON
    return response.json();
  })
);
```

## Using await Inside Loops like trash

Using `await` inside for or `forEach` doesn't leverage concurrent resolution, which makes our code slower than it needs to be:

```js
// Trash 🗑️
for (const url of urls) {
  const data = await fetch(url);
  console.log(data);
}

// Not Trash 💐
const data = await Promise.all(
  urls.map((url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json()))
);
console.log(data);
```

## Top-level scope

You cannot use `await` directly at the _top level_ in apps that do not support it. So if you find yourself working in older version of Node.js or your apps require backwards compatibility then you will be in a world of pain should you choose to not have a `main` function

```js
// Trash 🗑️
try {
  // await async operation
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message);
}

// Not Trash 💐
const main = async () => {
  try {
    // await async operation
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
};
main();
```

## Stinky urls

Although you may think you know how to call the URL directly in JavaScript, this may not necessarily be the case. A good reflex to have is to check PostMan first to formulate yor request then translate that to JavaScript.

# Exercise 2

Building on our exercise 1, using the `id`s of each pokemon, `fetch` the species details of each pokemon to determine their `base_happiness`. Once you discover all the happiness levels sort them from happiest pokemon to least happy pokemon:

## Solution

```js
const pokemonNames = ["ditto", "pikachu", "squirtle", "charizard", "bulbasaur"];

// Create a generic fetch function for reusability
const fetchData = async (urls) => {
  return await Promise.all(
    urls.map(async (url) => {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      return response.json();
    })
  );
};

const main = async () => {
  try {
    // step 1 - get the ids
    const pokemons = await fetchData(
      pokemonNames.map((name) => `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`)
    );
    // step 2 - extract ids to formulate URLs
    const speciesUrls = pokemons.map((pokemon) => ({
      name: pokemon.name,
      url: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/${pokemon.id}/`,
    }));

    // step 3 - fetch species information
    const speciesData = await fetchData(speciesUrls.map((item) => item.url));

    // step 4 - extract happiness levels
    const results = speciesUrls.map((item, index) => ({
      name: item.name,
      happiness: speciesData[index].base_happiness,
    }));

    // Log the results
    results.forEach((pokemon) => {
      console.log(`${pokemon.name}: Happiness Level - ${pokemon.happiness}`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("TRASHHHHHHHH: ", error);
  }
};

main();
```
