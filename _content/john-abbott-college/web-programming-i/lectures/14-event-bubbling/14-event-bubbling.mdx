# Quick Recap

We have been learning about Event Listeners for the last bit and different types of events and today we are going to make more sense of this conceptually.

# Event Bubbling

Let's say we got three divs organized in this order:

```js
<div class="one">
  <div class="two">
    <div class="three"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

# Summary

Defines the order in which events occur.

Bubbling: Start from the child and work up to the parent

Capturing: Start with the parent and work to the child
