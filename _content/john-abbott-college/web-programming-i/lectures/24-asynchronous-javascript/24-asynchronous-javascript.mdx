# Ajax

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

Allows parts of web pages to be asynchronously updated without reloading the whole page.

It is not a programming language, it is a technique.

Uses the browser XMLHttpRequest object.

# Asynchronous execution

Asynchronous request: does not block execution

Asynchronous execution of tasks example:
start download of movie working…
don’t wait for movie download to finish, start popcorn right away while movie is still downloading
start microwave popcorn working..
don’t wait for popcorn and movie download to finish, start setting up the couch right away while
the other tasks are still in progress
set up couch

# Synchronous execution

Asynchronous request: does not block execution

Opposite: Synchronous execution of tasks example:
start download of movie // wait for it to finish
only when last task is done (when the movie is done downloading) go on to the next task,
microwaving the popcorn
start popcorn // wait for it finish
only when last task is done (when the popcorn is done) go on to the next task, setting up the
couch
set up the couch
