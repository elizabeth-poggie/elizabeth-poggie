# HTML5 Canvas

## What is it?

The HTML5 Canvas is a fun graphics container that allows you to use JavaScript to draw and create _dynamic graphics_ directly in your web page. :^)

```html
<canvas></canvas>
```

For example, this is a fun rectangle:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

## Important things to know

- The `id` attribute is used to reference the canvas element in your JavaScript
- The `style` property will actually make your canvas visible.

For example:

```CSS
#myCanvas {
    border: 2px solid lightcoral;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

# Arts and Crafts

To start doing arts and crafts with code on the `<canvas>`, you need to access its context:

```js
let ctx = c.getContext("2d");
```

## What does this do?

- The `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()` method gives you a drawing context that you can use to render graphics on the canvas
- `"2d"` indicates a "two-dimensional" rendering context, allowing you to work with _flat, 2D graphics_ like lines, shapes, and text. You can explore more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)

## Why 2 dimensions tho?

The `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface is the tool that lets you draw 2D objects, like rectangles, text, images, and more, on the canvas element. Think of it like a blank sheet of paper except you code the fun parts.

## Rectangles within Rectangles

Before getting started, make sure your JavaScript contains the following:

```js
// Step 0 - Create a canvas
const c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
let ctx = c.getContext("2d");
```

And now you can start having fun:

```js
// Step 1 - create a pleasant color for the rectangle
ctx.fillStyle = "lightblue";
// Step 2 - Create a rectangle at (50,50) with width 100 and height 25
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 25);
```
