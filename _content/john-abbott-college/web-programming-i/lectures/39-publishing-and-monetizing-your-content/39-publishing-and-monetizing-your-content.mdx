- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) 👉 HD content (remember to sort by the License "Free")
- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) 👉 Turn screen recordings into gifs so your demos look fancy
- [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/maker) 👉 Turn screen recordings into gifs if you want to make bootleg animations

Happy creating :^)

# GitHub Pages

Once you have your private repo ready, let's cook with some GAS 🧑‍🍳🔥

## Configuring your repo

- Ensure that your `index.html` is in the ROOT of your project
- Go to your repository’s Settings tab
- Scroll down to the "Pages" section (in the "Code and automation" category on the left)
- Under Source, choose the branch you want to deploy from. You have 2 options:
  - `main` 👉 What I do for this very website (except a bit more complicated)
  - `gh-pages` 👉 What I do for your assignment deployments
- Select Save

## Demo

## Accessing your site

```JS
`https://${username}.github.io/${repository-name}`
```

## Custom domains

If you want to use your own domain:

- Go to the Pages section in Settings.
- Add your custom domain in the Custom domain field.
- Remember DNS from User Interfaces? This is where you apply that knowledge :^) Update your domain's DNS settings to include a record pointing to `username.github.io`
