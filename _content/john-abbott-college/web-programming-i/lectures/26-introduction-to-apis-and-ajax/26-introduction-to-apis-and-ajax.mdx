# Quick Recap

## How can the UI stay responsive while handling server requests, lazy loading images, and more?

Itâ€™s thanks to the browser's event loop and asynchronous processing, which let background tasks run without blocking user interactions. It's also why JavaScript when executed does not necessarily happen in order :^)

## What is AJAX?

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows web pages to fetch data from a server and update content without reloading the page

## How do reducers work in JavaScript?

Refer to the previous lecture for a detailed explanation however please see attached a really cool `gif` that covers the concept well:

# Intro to APIs

Connectivity is an amazing thing that we likely have come to take for granted in recent years. If i want any product it will appear at my doorstep within 24 hours and if I want to learn anything it's at my finger tips.

In a lot of ways, everything I want, I can get almost instantaneously.

## How does this happen?

How does data get from here to there? How does data get from here to there? From me to you?

How do different devices stay in sync with each other? I can send a message on instagram on my phone and have that reflected in the Desktop application immediately. Why is that?

The unsung hero of our connected world is the Application Programming Interface (or API) for short.

## What is an API?

An API is the messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do and then returns the response to you.

## Conceptual Example

Another way to think of this concept is to think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant.

Imagine you are setting at a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from and the kitchen that is the part of the system that will fulfill your order.

What's missing is the link that will communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That's where the waiter comes in.

The waiter is the messenger that will take your request (e.g. order) and tells the system, in this case the kitchen, what to do. It then delivers the response back to you, e.g. food.

## Real World Example

Just like at a restaurant, you have a menu of options to choose from. Select what you want from the service and use the API to send your request.

The API is

In order to get your data you can interact with it via postman or just a plain website to send your request to a system.
