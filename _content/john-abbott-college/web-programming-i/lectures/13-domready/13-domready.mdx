# event.preventDefault()

You use `event.preventDefault()` in JavaScript to stop the _default_ action that is triggered by an event.

## Why do I need to use this for form submissions?

When you submit a form and when a button with `type="submit"` is clicked, the default behavior is for the browser to reload the page and send the form data to the server. This happens because forms were originally designed for server-side processing and now we are doing things client-side in JavaScript land.

## Why do I need this for submit events?

If you want to handle the form data using JavaScript because you want to create custom error messages and need to prevent the default form submission behavior, _you need to prevent the default form submission behavior_.

This is why `event.preventDefault()` in form submission handlers is necessary.

## What about onSubmit="" ?

The onSubmit event handler in forms can be written in two common ways to prevent the form from submitting and reloading the page:

- Using `event.preventDefault()`
- Returning `false` from the handler

Returning `false` from an `onSubmit` event handler is an _older_ approach to prevent form submission. In HTML, when an event handler returns `false`, it implicitly prevents the default action of the event, just like `event.preventDefault()`.

## Why do I not need this for click events?

When you use an `onclick` event on a button, no default behavior like page reload or data submission is triggered by the browser. Instead, the code inside your `onclick` event runs directly without needing to prevent anything.

To summarize the key differences:

- Form Submission Triggers a Page Reload
- Button Click Doesnâ€™t Trigger a Reload

## Examples

To demonstrate the differences of these concepts. Let's first take a look at how `event.preventDefault()` is used:

```html
<form id="myForm" action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  document
    .getElementById("myForm")
    .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault(); /* notice this */
      $("#nope").show();
    });
</script>
```

if you wanted to use an inline event listener, you could do this, but it would be bad form:

```html
<form
  id="myForm"
  action="submit-form.php"
  target="_blank"
  method="post"
  onsubmit="event.preventDefault(); $('#nope').show();"
>
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Adopting the old school way of handing `onSubmit`, your code may look like this:

```html
<form
  id="myForm"
  action="submit-form.php"
  target="_blank"
  method="post"
  onsubmit="return handleSubmit()"
>
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  function handleSubmit() {
    $("#nope").show();
    return false;
  }
</script>
```

and compared to a simple button, we don't need to prevent any default behavior because there is nothing to stop.

```html
<div>
  <button id="myButton">I'm a cool button</button>
  <span id="yup" class="ok">button click 4 u</span>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
    $("#yup").show();
  });
</script>
```

However we have been mixing vanilla JavaScript AND jQuery. There has to be a better way.

# DOMReady

The `DOMReady` event in JavaScript refers to the point when the DOM has been fully loaded and parsed. This event is different from window.onload, which fires when the entire page, including all resources like images and stylesheets, has loaded.
