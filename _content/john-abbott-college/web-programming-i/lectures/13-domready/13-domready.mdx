# event.preventDefault()

You use `event.preventDefault()` in JavaScript to stop the _default_ action that is triggered by an event.

## Why do I need to use this for form submissions?

When you submit a form and when a button with `type="submit"` is clicked, the default behavior is for the browser to reload the page and send the form data to the server. This happens because forms were originally designed for server-side processing and now we are doing things client-side in JavaScript land.

## Why do I need this for submit events?

If you want to handle the form data using JavaScript because you want to create custom error messages and need to prevent the default form submission behavior, _you need to prevent the default form submission behavior_.

This is why `event.preventDefault()` in form submission handlers is necessary.

## What about onSubmit="" ?

The onSubmit event handler in forms can be written in two common ways to prevent the form from submitting and reloading the page:

- Using `event.preventDefault()`
- Returning `false` from the handler

Returning `false` from an `onSubmit` event handler is an _older_ approach to prevent form submission. In HTML, when an event handler returns `false`, it implicitly prevents the default action of the event, just like `event.preventDefault()`.

## Why do I not need this for click events?

When you use an `onclick` event on a button, no default behavior like page reload or data submission is triggered by the browser. Instead, the code inside your `onclick` event runs directly without needing to prevent anything.

To summarize the key differences:

- Form Submission Triggers a Page Reload
- Button Click Doesnâ€™t Trigger a Reload
