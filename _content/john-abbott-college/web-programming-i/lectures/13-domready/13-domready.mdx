# event.preventDefault()

The `event.preventDefault()` method in JavaScript is used to stop the default action associated with an event from occurring.

## Why Do I Need This for Form Submissions?

When you submit a form or click a button with `type="submit"`, the browser's default behavior is to reload the page and send the form data to the server. This "default" behavior stems from the traditional use of forms for server-side processing, whereas we often want to handle form submissions client-side with JavaScript.

## Why Do I Need This for Submit Events?

f your goal is to manage the form data with JavaScript to create custom error messages or perform validation, ou must prevent the default form submission behavior. This is why using `event.preventDefault()` in form submission handlers is necessary.

## What about onSubmit="" ?

The onSubmit event handler can be written in two common ways to prevent a form from submitting and reloading the page:

- Using `event.preventDefault()`
- Returning `false` from the handler

Returning `false` from an `onSubmit` event handler is an _older_ approach that implicitly prevents the default action of the event, just like `event.preventDefault()`.

## Why Do I Not Need This for Click Events?

When using an `onclick` event on a button, the browser does not trigger any default behavior like page reload or data submission. Instead, the code within your `onclick` event runs directly, without needing to prevent anything.

## Summary

To summarize the key differences are:

- Form Submissions ðŸ‘‰ Trigger a page reload _by default_
- Button Clicks ðŸ‘‰ Does NOT trigger a reload

## Examples

To demonstrate the differences of these concepts. Let's first take a look at how `event.preventDefault()` is used:

```html
<form id="myForm" action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  document
    .getElementById("myForm")
    .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault(); /* notice this */
      $("#nope").show();
    });
</script>
```

If you were to use an inline event listener, it could look like this, though it's _not recommended_:

```html
<form
  id="myForm"
  action="submit-form.php"
  target="_blank"
  method="post"
  onsubmit="event.preventDefault(); $('#nope').show();"
>
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Using the old school approach, your code might appear as follows:

```html
<form
  id="myForm"
  action="submit-form.php"
  target="_blank"
  method="post"
  onsubmit="return handleSubmit()"
>
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  function handleSubmit() {
    $("#nope").show();
    return false;
  }
</script>
```

In contrast, for a simple button, no default behavior needs to be prevented since there is nothing to stop:

```html
<div>
  <button id="myButton">I'm a cool button</button>
  <span id="yup" class="ok">button click 4 u</span>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
    $("#yup").show();
  });
</script>
```

However, mixing vanilla JavaScript with jQuery may lead to complexity. This is where the jQuery `.ready()` function comes into play.

# $().ready()

The jQuery `.ready()` function ensures that your code runs only after the DOM is fully loaded and ready to be used.

## How Is This State Captured in Our Webpage?

`.ready()` listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event. This event signals that the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, making all DOM elements accessible.

## How does this work?

- Event Listening: When you use `$(document).ready()`, jQuery attaches an event listener to the document. This listener waits for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to fire.
- Code Execution: Once the DOM is ready, any code inside the `.ready()` function is executed. This ensures you can safely manipulate DOM elements without encountering issues related to unavailable elements.

## How does this relate to form validation?

When working with forms, it is often necessary to validate data or manipulate elements before submission. By using the DOM ready event handler, you ensure that all form elements are available for your manipulations.

Returning to our earlier example, hereâ€™s how it looks when adapted to work with `.ready()`:

```html
<form id="myForm" action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
    <span id="nope" class="warning">no form submission 4 you</span>
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

<script>
  // First ensure the DOM is fully loaded.
  $(document).ready(function () {
    // Event listener for form submission
    $("#myForm").on("submit", function (event) {
      // Prevent the default form submission
      event.preventDefault();
      $("#nope").show();
    });
  });
</script>
```

In this example, we wait until the DOM is fully ready using `$(document).ready()` before adding a submit event listener to the form. The listener prevents the default submission if the username field is empty and displays an error message.

## Why Can't I Just Use .on()?

Wrapping your jQuery code in `$(document).ready()` is important to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before your JavaScript executes:

- If your script runs before the DOM is fully loaded, it won't find the elements (like `#myForm`) because they haven't been created yet. Without `$(document).ready()`, trying to attach event handlers or perform actions on those elements MAY fail.
- Itâ€™s a best practice in jQuery to use `$(document).ready()` to avoid potential problems, especially in larger applications where scripts might be placed in various locations. While things may seem simpler now, unpredictable behavior WILL lead to painful midnight debugging sessions in larger projects.

Think of this as like DOM consent. You can only access the DOM when it is ready, and the DOM communicates it's consent is through the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

## Can We Use This Same Concept for Images?

No lol.

When we need to add an event listener to an image instead of a form, we may encounter different scenarios and for this I need to introduce another event.

# Exercise 1

Form a group of up to three people, but if you prefer to work independently, that's fine too.

## The Task

Head over to [Omnivox](https://johnabbott.omnivox.ca/Login/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fintr%2f) and try to replicate the form submission behavior using jQuery. Your form should include:

- A _Student ID_ field
- A _Password_ field
- Custom error handling, displayed as follows:

```md
# Error

Your Username or your password is invalid.

Make sure you have selected the correct type of user above and try again.
```

If you want to include more in your work, go for it :)

## Solution

To start, copy and paste the styles directly from Omnivox:

```css
.wrongUser {
  background-color: #ffcdd2;
  border-radius: 6px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 0;
  color: #b71c1c;
  font-size: 16px;
  display: none;
}

.warning {
  color: #f44336;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  display: none;
}
```

Your HTML should close to the following:

```html
<div id="errorMessage" class="wrongUser">
  <h2>Error</h2>
  <p>Your username or password is invalid.</p>
  <p>
    Please ensure you have selected the correct user type above and try again.
  </p>
</div>
<form id="loginForm">
  <div>
    <label for="studentId">Student ID:</label>
    <input type="text" id="studentId" placeholder="Enter Student ID" />
    <span class="warning" id="idError"
      >The 'Student ID' field is required.</span
    >
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter Password" />
    <span class="warning" id="passwordError"
      >The 'Password' field is required.</span
    >
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

And finally add the JavaScript code:

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  $("#loginForm").on("submit", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Get the values from the form fields
    var studentId = $("#studentId").val();
    var password = $("#password").val();

    // error showing
    if (!studentId) {
      $("#idError").show();
    }

    if (!password) {
      $("#passwordError").show();
    }

    // if we showed an error, we should exit early
    if (!studentId || !password) {
      return;
    }

    // Example user
    if (studentId === "42" && password === "password") {
      alert("Redirecting to LEA ...");

      // Redirect (for demo purposes)
      window.location.href = "https://johnabbott.omnivox.ca/intr/";
    } else {
      $("#errorMessage").show();
    }
  });
});
```

# Load

The `load` event is important, especially in managing web pages and their resources.

## Why is Load important?

The `load` vent triggers when the entire page, including all dependent resources like images and stylesheets, has finished loading. Attempting to manipulate elements before they are fully loaded can lead to errors, as those elements may not yet be present in the DOM.

## DOMContentLoaded vs Load

The `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events are both important for handling when content is available in the browser, but they serve different purposes and are triggered at different times.

## Timing is EVERYTHING

`DOMContentLoaded` fires when the DOM is fully constructed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, or other external resources. Itâ€™s ideal for running scripts that need to interact with the DOM but do not depend on other resources. A common use case is for `<form>` submissions.

```js
// Using jQuery
$(document).ready(function () {
  console.log("DOM is ready");
});

// Using pure JS
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  console.log("DOM is ready");
});
```

`load` fires when _everything_ on the page, including all resources like images and stylesheets, is completely loaded. This is important for scripts that manipulate images or _require_ fully loaded styles.

```js
// Using jQuery
$(window).on("load", function () {
  console.log("EVERYTHING is loaded");
});

// Using pure JS
window.addEventListener("load", function () {
  console.log("Everything is fully loaded");
});
```

## When to use what

- `DOMContentLoaded` ðŸ‘‰ Fires when the DOM is ready
- `load` ðŸ‘‰ Fires when _everything_ is fully loaded
