# JSON continued

We covered JSON at a high level in previous classes, today we cover it in greater detail

## What is it?

- A standard text-based format for representing structured data that's _very_ popular
- It's based on JavaScript object syntax, but it is independent of JavaScript (could be used anywhere)

## When do we use it?

- It's often used to transfer data from web server to browser (client).
- When we transfer it, it is represented as a string because that's great for transfer.

## How do we make sure JavaScript is happy when dealing with JSON?

JavaScript provides a JSON object with methods to convert it to a JavaScript object.

# JSON vs JavaScript

## JSON data types

In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

- a string (e.g. `"Don't Panic"`)
- a number (e.g. `42`)
- an object (e.g. JSON object)
- an array (e.g. `[stuff]`)
- a boolean (e.g. `true`/ `false`)
- `null` (angry user defined error)

## JavaScript data types

In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:

- a function (e.g. `() => stuff`)
- a date
- `undefined` (angry JavaScript defined error)

## Examples

JSON Syntax:

```json
{
  "name": "Arthur Dent",
  "age": 42,
  "isPanicking": false,
  "items": ["blanket", "towel", "coffee"],
  "spaceship": null
}
```

Fun fact with the [autoformatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) when you assign this object to a constant will immediately turn it into a JavaScript object :^)

JavaScript Object Syntax:

```js
// you cant put comments in a json file
const arthur = {
  name: "Arthur Dent",
  age: 42,
  isPanicking: false,
  items: ["blanket", "towel", "coffee"],
  spaceship: undefined, // JSON doesn't support undefined lol
  panic() {
    this.isPanicking = true;
    console.log("AHHHHHHH");
  },
};
```

## Key differences

JSON requires _double_ quotes to be used around _property names_ and _values_ that are strings (unlike in JavaScript). Single quotes are not valid.

Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong. (which is always lovely when it happens)

# Converting and Parsing JSON

Sometimes we want to receive JSON from a server and sometimes we are the server that wants to send JSON.

## Examples

JavaScript object => JSON

```js
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(arthur);
console.log(jsonString); // notice how some previously defined properties disappear
```

JSON => JavaScript object

```js
const processedArthur = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(processedArthur);
```

# Usage and Best Practices

## Response.json()

Remember this example from yesterday?

```js
const response = await fetch(url);
const json = await response.json();
```

`response.json()` in JavaScript automatically parses the JSON for you, so you don't need to use `JSON.parse()` on the result.

## localStorage / sessionStorage

Data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage is stored as a string, so when we retrieve it, we need to parse it into an object to work with it.

```js
// Saving Arthur to localStorage
localStorage.setItem("storedArthur", JSON.stringify(arthur));

// Retrieving Arthur and parsing him
const storedArthur = localStorage.getItem("storedArthur");
const parsedArthur = JSON.parse(storedArthur);
console.log(parsedArthur); // notice which attributes are missing
```

## XMLHttpRequests

If youâ€™re getting data using `XMLHttpRequest`, youâ€™ll need to use `JSON.parse()` to handle the response:

```js
// init request
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
// GET ditto
xhr.open("GET", "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto");
// create handler
xhr.onload = function () {
  // ensure status is ok
  if (xhr.status === 200) {
    // Manually parse the JSON
    const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    // log data
    console.log(data);
  }
};
// yeet request
xhr.send();
```

## Obscure APIs

Most modern APIs handle JSON parsing with `response.json()`, HOWEVER if you encounter APIs or libraries that unfortunately return a raw JSON string, so you gotta use `JSON.parse()`

# Exercise 1

Create a user object that holds your player's stats, then save this object to `localStorage`. After that, retrieve the stats from `localStorage` and log them to the console.

Food for thought: How would you check what's currently stored in `localStorage`?

## Solution

```js
const player = {
  name: "ReadyPlayerOne",
  level: 5,
  experience: 1200,
  health: 100,
  inventory: ["big stick", "towel", "will power"],
};

localStorage.setItem("playerStats", JSON.stringify(player));
const storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("playerStats"));

console.log(storedUser);
```

# Local Storage / Session Storage side tangent

ðŸ’¡ Note: I won't test you on this storage stuff, however adding this section for the curious

`localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are both types of web storage provided by the browser that allow you to store data in a mini-database within your browser. The stuff we save here usually doesn't get saved to the server!!

## Local Storage

Data saved in `localStorage` is persistent and remains there even after the user closes the browser or restarts their device. There is a limit to this btw, the capacity is limited to around 5-10 MB

## Session Storage

Data stored in `sessionStorage` is temporary and only lasts for the duration of the browser session. Has a similar capacity to `localStorage`

## How does this differ from cookies?

Cookies can be set to expire at a specific date and time, or they can deleted when the session ends. Their capacity is at 4 KB per cookie which is much smaller than the above storage options.

## How come so many companies want you to accept their cookie policy?

Cookies are accessible to both the client AND the server. `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` however are both only accessible _on the client side_, meaning that it's a secret to the server. How else will companies be able to steal your data?

# defer / async

More info: https://javascript.info/script-async-defer

```html
<script src="myFile.js"></script>

<script defer src="myFile.js"></script>

<script async src="myFile.js"></script>
```

What's going on here?

```html
<script defer src="myFile.js"></script>
load file in background (get it from server) run js code only when DOM is ready
(can retrieve HTML Element object in script)

<script async src="myFile.js"></script>
load file in background (get it from server) run js code as soon as file loaded.
(DOM might not be ready)

<script src="myFile.js"></script>
load file right away (block rest of page) run js code as soon as file loaded.
(DOM might not be ready)
```

## Whats the steps?

https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html#script

The async attribute is useful when the script is not used for DOM manipulation. Sometimes you need a script only for server-side operations or for handling cache or cookies, but not for DOM manipulations.

The defer attribute is important when the script is used for DOM manipulations.
defer scripts are guaranteed to execute in order.

The function to run after the specified time. The function takes no parameters.
The specified time in ms.
