# JSON continued

We covered JSON at a high level in previous classes, today we cover it in greater detail

## What is it?

- A standard text-based format for representing structured data that's _very_ popular
- It's based on JavaScript object syntax, but it is independent of JavaScript (could be used anywhere)

## When do we use it?

- It's often used to transfer data from web server to browser (client).
- When we transfer it, it is represented as a string because that's great for transfer.

## How do we make sure JavaScript is happy when dealing with JSON?

JavaScript provides a JSON object with methods to convert it to a JavaScript object.

# JSON vs JavaScript

## JSON data types

In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

- a string (e.g. `"Don't Panic"`)
- a number (e.g. `42`)
- an object (e.g. JSON object)
- an array (e.g. `[stuff]`)
- a boolean (e.g. `true`/ `false`)
- `null` (angry user defined error)

## JavaScript data types

In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:

- a function (e.g. `() => stuff`)
- a date (e.g. `2024-11-04`)
- `undefined` (angry JavaScript defined error)

## Key differences

JSON requires _double_ quotes to be used around _property names_ and _values_ that are strings (unlike in JavaScript). Single quotes are not valid.

Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong. (which is always lovely when it happens)

# Converting between types

JSON => JavaScript object

```js
let superHeroes = JSON.parse(superHeroesText);
```

JavaScript object => JSON

```js
let myJavaScriptObject = { name: "Chris", age: 38 };
let myJSONString = JSON.stringify(myJavaScriptObject);
```

# Exercise 1

# defer / async

More info: https://javascript.info/script-async-defer

```html
<script src="myFile.js"></script>

<script defer src="myFile.js"></script>

<script async src="myFile.js"></script>
```

What's going on here?

```html
<script defer src="myFile.js"></script>
load file in background (get it from server) run js code only when DOM is ready
(can retrieve HTML Element object in script)

<script async src="myFile.js"></script>
load file in background (get it from server) run js code as soon as file loaded.
(DOM might not be ready)

<script src="myFile.js"></script>
load file right away (block rest of page) run js code as soon as file loaded.
(DOM might not be ready)
```

## Whats the steps?

The async attribute is useful when the script is not used for DOM manipulation. Sometimes you need a script only for server-side operations or for handling cache or cookies, but not for DOM manipulations.

The defer attribute is important when the script is used for DOM manipulations.
defer scripts are guaranteed to execute in order.

takes in two parameters:
The function to run after the specified time. The function takes no parameters.
The specified time in ms.
