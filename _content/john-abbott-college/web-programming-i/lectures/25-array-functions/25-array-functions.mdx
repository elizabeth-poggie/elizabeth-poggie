# Array Functions you know

Arrays in JavaScript come with several built-in methods that make life easier. So far we have seen there guys:

```js
// Add a single item to the end of an array
myArray.push(item);
// Add multiple items to the end of an array
myArray.push(item1, item2);
// Remove the last item from an array
myArray.pop();
// Get the length of an array
myArray.length;
// Find the index of a specific item in the array
myArray.indexOf(findItem);
```

If you need to run a function on every item in the array, `forEach()` is your go-to method:

```js
// Apply some function to each item in the array
myArray.forEach(someFunction);
```

Today we will cover other fancy array methods

# Sorting Methods

JavaScript provides built-in methods like `.sort()` and `.reverse()` to handle sorting and reversing the order of array elements.

## Reversing an Array

The `reverse()` method modifies the original array by inverting the order of its items:

```js
let myArray = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4];
myArray.reverse();

console.log(myArray);
```

## Sorting an Array

The `sort()` method modifies the original by sorting it's oder by its converted string value or by a defined function:

```js
let vegetables = ["carrots", "brocoli", "asparagus"];
vegetables.sort();

console.log(vegetables);
```

By default, `sort()` converts elements into strings and compares their characters, which means that `sort`ing numbers may not behave as expected unless you provide a comparison function:

```js
let numbers = [12, 5, 20, 1];
numbers.sort();

console.log(numbers);
```

In the above code snippet, 12 and 20 will unfortunately come before 5. Why? By default, `sort()` compares sequences of `UTF-16` code units.

1 and 2 come before 5 after all. So how do we fix this to work properly?

## Sorting numbers correctly

To sort numbers correctly, you should pass a comparison function to `sort()`:

```js
// Ascending order
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers);

// Descending order
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(numbers);
```

Why do the methods look like this?

- In the function `(a, b) => a - b`, if the result is _negative_, `a` comes before `b`; if positive, `b` comes before `a`. This gives the result of by sorting by Ascending order.
- Similarly, in the function `(a, b) => b - a`, if the result is _negative_, `b` comes before `a`; if positive, `a` comes before `b`. This gives the result of sorting by Descending order.

# Mapping an Array

The `map()` method is used to transform or modify each element in an array.

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let newArray = myArray.map((x) => {
  return x + 2;
});

console.log(newArray); // 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
console.log(myArray); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

It applies the provided function to every element and returns a new array without changing the original array.

## When do you use map?

- When you want to apply a function to every element in an array and return a transformed array.
- When you need to modify values, but want to preserve the original array for future reference.

# Exercise 1

In your assignment 3, try to generate an array of checkbox elements from their parent div using `map`

## Solution (ish)

```js
// Step 1: Select the parent div that contains the checkboxes
const checkboxContainer = document.querySelector(".a-cool-container");

// Step 2: Use map to generate an array of checkbox elements from the children
const checkboxes = Array.from(checkboxContainer.children).map((child) => {
  // Step 3: Check if the child is an input of type checkbox
  if (child.type === "checkbox") {
    return child;
  }
});
```

# Exercise 2

In your assignment 3, using `map` again to create an array of booleans, indicating whether each `checkbox` is checked.

## Solution-ish

What function should I pass to `map`?

```js
(checkbox) => checkbox.checked;
```

# Reducing Arrays

## Accumulators

## To a single number

Reduces the array to a single number using a function that is applied to every number in the array, left to right

```js
let myArray = [14, 8, 10];

let result = myArray.reduce((total, num) => {
  return total + num;
});
```

## To Multiple Categories

```js
let animals = [
  { type: "cat", name: "Bill", age: 3 },
  { type: "cat", name: "Spaghetti", age: 1 },
  { type: "bird", name: "Olive", age: 15 },
  { type: "cat", name: "Arthur Dent", age: 11 },
  { type: "bird", name: "Beak", age: 12 },
];
```

# Exercise 2

n Assignment 3, apply the `reduce` method to the boolean array to check if all checkboxes are selected.

## Solution(ish)

```js
const result = checkboxStates.reduce((acc, cur) => acc && cur, true);
```

# Even more Methods

Concatenation:

```js
let myArray1 = ["apples", "pears"];
let myArray2 = ["cucumbers", "olives", "cheese"];
let myMergedArray = myArray1.concat(myArray2);
```

Filtering:

```js
let numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let over18 = numbers.filter((val) => value > 18);
```
