# Creating your own webserver

Today we are going to take our Lazy Loading knowledge to the next level

## Getting started

Create an empty Node.js project with an entry point `index.js`

```md
myServer
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
```

## Importing the Modules

In your `index.js` import the required modules to create a basic server:

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");
```

In Node.js, `fs` and `http` are "core modules", which means they come pre-installed with Node.js and do not need to be included in your `package.json` as dependencies. What does this mean for you? You don't need to `npm install` these guys.

## Why these Modules?

- http ðŸ‘‰ Provides functionality to create and manage HTTP servers
- fs ðŸ‘‰ Provides functions for interacting with the file system

Fun fact: I use `fs` to fetch [this very note](https://github.com/elizabeth-poggie/elizabeth-poggie/blob/main/src/utils/helpers/noteFetchers.ts#L1) :^)

## Creating a Server

Shockingly, all you need to do to create a server using `http` is as follows:

```js
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  // other stuff
});
```

This function runs every time the server receives a request, with `req` representing the request and `res` representing the response. Some examples include:

- `req` options: "GET", "POST"
- `res` options: "200 OK", "404 Not Found"

## Reading Files

Now that the skeleton of the server is set up, try to read a file:

```js
fs.readFile("demo.html", "utf8", function (err, data) {
  // other stuff
});
```

- `err` is an error object.
- `data` is the content of the file.

## Sending a Response

If the file is successfully read, the server responds with a status code of `200` and it successfully fetched the contents from the server. If all is well, we now write the data (HTML content) to the response

```js
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
res.write(data);
return res.end();
```

## Listening on a project

Finally, the server is set to `listen` on port `5555`. This means you can access the server by navigating to http://localhost:5555 in your browser.

```js
http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    // other stuff
  })
  .listen(5555);
```

## Running our server

To start our server, simply type the following:

```bash
node .
```

Now when we navigate to our server on port `5555`, we will be able to see the contents of `demo.html` as it's being "served" up.

## All Together

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile("demo.html", function (err, data) {
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
      res.write(data);
      return res.end();
    });
  })
  .listen(5555);
```

# Exercise 1

# Exercise 2

Your job is to:

- Find 3 hi-res images from the internet and optimize them for a webpage.
- Create a webpage that contains your images
- How does the page load time compare when using lazy loading vs not?

```

```
