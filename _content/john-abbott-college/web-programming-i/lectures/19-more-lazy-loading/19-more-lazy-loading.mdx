# Creating your own webserver

Today we are going to take our Lazy Loading knowledge to the next level

## Getting started

Create an empty Node.js project with an entry point `index.js`

```md
myServer
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
```

## Importing the Modules

In your `index.js` import the required modules to create a basic server:

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");
```

In Node.js, `fs` and `http` are "core modules", which means they come pre-installed with Node.js and do not need to be included in your `package.json` as dependencies. What does this mean for you? You don't need to `npm install` these guys.

## Why these Modules?

- http ðŸ‘‰ Provides functionality to create and manage HTTP servers
- fs ðŸ‘‰ Provides functions for interacting with the file system

Fun fact: I use `fs` to fetch [this very note](https://github.com/elizabeth-poggie/elizabeth-poggie/blob/main/src/utils/helpers/noteFetchers.ts#L1) :^)

## Creating a Server

Shockingly, all you need to do to create a server using `http` is as follows:

```js
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  // other stuff
});
```

This function runs every time the server receives a request, with `req` representing the request and `res` representing the response. Some examples include:

- `req` options: "GET", "POST"
- `res` options: "200 OK", "404 Not Found"

## Reading Files

Now that the skeleton of the server is set up, try to read a file:

```js
fs.readFile("demo.html", "utf8", function (err, data) {
  // other stuff
});
```

- `err` is an error object.
- `data` is the content of the file.

## Sending a Response

If the file is successfully read, the server responds with a status code of `200` and it successfully fetched the contents from the server. If all is well, we now write the data (HTML content) to the response

```js
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
res.write(data);
return res.end();
```

## Listening on a project

Finally, the server is set to `listen` on port `5555`. This means you can access the server by navigating to http://localhost:5555 in your browser.

```js
http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    // other stuff
  })
  .listen(5555);
```

## Running our server

To start our server, simply type the following:

```bash
node .
```

Now when we navigate to our server on port `5555`, we will be able to see the contents of `demo.html` as it's being "served" up.

## All Together

```js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile("demo.html", function (err, data) {
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
      res.write(data);
      return res.end();
    });
  })
  .listen(5555);
```

# Exercise 1

As an exercise, try to set up a server in groups that serves a webpage on port `4242`

## Solution

```js
// index.js
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile("my-cool-server.html", function (err, data) {
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
      res.write(data);
      return res.end();
    });
  })
  .listen(4242);
```

# Fancier Servers

Instead of using the default `http` server, let's use `http-server` instead. This is a simple, lightweight, and zero-configuration command-line tool for serving static files over HTTP.

Since we can serve "static" content with this, we can simply start our project with an `index.html`. Why is this handy? Well now we can incorporate cool stuff like `jquery` into our projects :^)

## Getting Started

Install the dependency using `npm` if you just want to use it in your specific project:

```bash
npm install http-server
```

You should see your folder structure get updated to the following if setting up just for this project:

```md
myServer
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependency _globally_ using the `-g` flag:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

## Troubleshooting

If you do not automatically get the `package.json`, you will have to add it manually and fill the file with an "empty" json object:

```json
// package.json
{}
```

Try rerunning the `npm install <dependency>` command and you should see the following in your `package.json` now:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^14.1.1" // could be another version tho
  }
}
```

## Using http-server

Open up your `package.json` and add the following:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server"
  }
  // other stuff
}
```

Running the file will work like this:

```bash
npm run start
```

You should see the following appear if all went well:

```bash
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.0.10:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

If you installed `http-server` with the global `-g` flag, then all you need to do to start the server is simply with this command

```bash
http-server
```
