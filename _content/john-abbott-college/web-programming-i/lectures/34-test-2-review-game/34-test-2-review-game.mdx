```

# Question 2

What will `myArray` hold after the code is run?

```js
let myArray = [4, 12, 6, 35, 39];
myArray.filter((x) => x % 3 === 0);
```

## Solution

```js

```

# Question 3

Given the following code:

```js
let myArray = [
  { year: 2018, model: "X" },
  { year: 2016, model: "S" },
];

let test = myArray.map((car) => car.model + "-turbo");
```

Which statements are `true`?

- `myArray` will remain unchanged
- `myArray` will hold an array of strings: `["X-turbo", "S-turbo"]`
- `myArray` will hold an array with the same objects but with modified model names
- `test` will hold the value `undefined`
- `test` will hold an array with two values: `[undefined, undefined]`
- `test` will hold an array of strings: `["X-turbo", "S-turbo"]`

## Solution

- ✅ `myArray` will remain unchanged
- ❌ `myArray` will hold an array of strings: `["X-turbo", "S-turbo"]`
- ❌ `myArray` will hold an array with the same objects but with modified model names
- ❌ `test` will hold the value `undefined`
- ❌ `test` will hold an array with two values: `[undefined, undefined]`
- ✅ `test` will hold an array of strings: `["X-turbo", "S-turbo"]`
