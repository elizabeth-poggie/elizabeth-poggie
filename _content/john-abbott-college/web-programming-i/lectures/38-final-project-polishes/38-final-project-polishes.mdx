# Fonts

Creating a strong brand identity is the beginnings of a marketing strategy to later monetize your project :^) Every strong Brand has a sleek style.

## Selecting a Font

You have several free options:

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) ðŸ‘‰ Free and easy to implement
- [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/) ðŸ‘‰ If you like a modern vibe
- [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/) ðŸ‘‰ Free, however might be a bit 90s

## Download the font

Fonts typically come these formats:

- `.woff` / `.woff2` ðŸ‘‰ The modern choice
- `.ttf` / `.otf` ðŸ‘‰ Traditional and less optimized for the web
- `.eot`ðŸ‘‰ If you are using this format you have failed as a developer as this is only really used for Internet Explorer.
- `.svg` ðŸ‘‰ What are you doing? This was maybe rarely used on like the first version of a blackberry

Once downloaded, make sure to put your `font` files in a dedicated folder (e.g., `./fonts/`)

## Using fonts with CSS

In `./styles/styles.css` add the following custom styles:

```css
/* Add your custom font to your CSS using @font-face */
@font-face {
  font-family: "My Cool Font";
  src: url("../fonts/MyCoolFont.woff2");
}

/* Use the custom font in your styles */
body {
  font-family: "My Cool Font", sans-serif;
}
```

And don't forget to import your sheet to the HTML doc:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/styles.css" />
```

# Health Bar

Creating a "Health Bar" has mutliple applications, from tracking points in a loyalty program, progress of your shipped package and the expected delivery day, all the way to your web game project :^)

## HTML Structure

To get started, let's create a skeleton for our bar:

```html
<div id="health-bar-container">
  <div id="health-bar"></div>
</div>
```

## CSS for Styling

Now that we have the base, we can make it cuter:

```css
#health-bar-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 30px;
  border: 2px solid #2a2a2a;
  border-radius: 20px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
}

#health-bar {
  height: 100%;
  /* Default full health */
  width: 100%;
  /* Default full health */
  background-color: #4caf50;
  /* Smooth transition when health changes */
  transition: width 0.3s ease;
}
```

## JavaScript Functionality

Now let's add some magic ðŸ¤¹

For now I will manually add these buttons to increase and decrease the health bar using inline event handlers:

```html
<button onclick="decreaseHealth(10)">Take Damage</button>
<button onclick="increaseHealth(10)">Heal</button>
```

However, keep in mind this can be handled differently using listeners in certain circumstances depending on the use case.

Now lets add some JS:

```js
// Init health value
let health = 100;

// Reusable function to update the health bar
function updateHealthBar() {
  const healthBar = document.getElementById("health-bar");
  // update the width dynamically
  healthBar.style.width = `${health}%`;

  // Change color dynamically
  if (health > 70) {
    // Green means GOOD
    healthBar.style.backgroundColor = "#4caf50";
  } else if (health > 30) {
    // Orange means things are SPOOKY
    healthBar.style.backgroundColor = "#ff9800";
  } else {
    // Red means your death is immanent
    healthBar.style.backgroundColor = "#f44336";
  }
}

// Call this function to decrease health
function decreaseHealth(amount) {
  // Pro Tip ðŸ‘‰ Prevent health from going below 0
  health = Math.max(0, health - amount);
  updateHealthBar();
}

// Call this function to increase health
function increaseHealth(amount) {
  // Pro Tip ðŸ‘‰ Prevent health from going above 100
  health = Math.min(100, health + amount);
  updateHealthBar();
}

// Pro Tip ðŸ‘‰ no need for a DOM ready check when using defer
updateHealthBar();
```
