# Fonts

Creating a strong brand identity is the beginnings of a marketing strategy to later monetize your project :^) Every strong Brand has a sleek style.

## Selecting a Font

You have several free options:

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) ðŸ‘‰ Free and easy to implement
- [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/) ðŸ‘‰ If you like a modern vibe
- [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/) ðŸ‘‰ Free, however might be a bit 90s

## Download the font

Fonts typically come these formats:

- .woff / .woff2: Modern, lightweight formats recommended for web use.
  .ttf / .otf: Traditional formats but less optimized for the web.
  .eot: Mostly for older versions of Internet Explorer.
  .svg: Rarely used, primarily for older mobile browsers.

Once downloaded, make sure to put your font files in a dedicated folder (e.g., `/fonts`)

## Using fonts with CSS

```css
/* Add your custom font to your CSS using @font-face */
@font-face {
  font-family: "My Cool Font";
  src: url("../fonts/MyCoolFont.woff2");
}

/* Use the custom font in your styles */
body {
  font-family: "My Cool Font", sans-serif;
}
```
