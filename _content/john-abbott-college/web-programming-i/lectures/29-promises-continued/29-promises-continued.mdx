# Promises

Let's continue what we talked about on tuesday with a more concrete example.

## What is a promise?

It is something that is unknown now and may become known sometime in the future.

## From Concept to JavaScript

Poggie "promises" to grade your Assignment 2. Here’s how this would look in JavaScript:

```js
function poggieMustGrade(assignment) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // poggie "promises" to grade your stuff
  });
}
```

Poggie has set her grading deadline for Wednesday, and she made this promise to the class on Tuesday. In JavaScript, this setup would look like this:

```js
function poggieMustGrade(assignment) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // Set a deadline (Wednesday)
    const deadline = new Date("2024-10-30");

    // simulate a wait period of 3 seconds instead of 3 days
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Get today's date
      const today = new Date();
      if (today <= deadline) {
        resolve(`Poggie graded your ${assignment.name} on time (wow)`);
      } else {
        reject(
          `Poggie slept thru her deadline and failed to grade your ${assignment.name}`
        );
      }
    }, 3000);
  });
}
```

Initially, the promise is _pending_. After "3 days," the promise either gets `resolve`d (you receive feedback) or `reject`ed (you don’t get feedback)

Here’s how you’d call this promise:

```js
poggieMustGrade({
  name: "Assignment 2",
  content: "some really cool code",
});
```

Using `then` to handle the result of the promise once fulfilled would look like this:

```js
poggieMustGrade({
  name: "Assignment 2",
  content: "some really cool code",
})
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Since today is Friday, you should expect this output:

```text
Poggie slept thru her deadline and failed to grade your Assignment 2
```

But if Poggie had `resolve`d grading your assignment on time, you’d see:

```text
Poggie graded your Assignment 2 on time (wow)
```

## What if I want to “chain” multiple actions together?

For example, after Poggie has graded your assignment, you want to check Lea for your grade.

## Chaining

Let’s add a new function called `checkGrade` that takes a `feedback` object and returns a boolean indicating whether you’ve read it:

```js
// example feedback object
const feedback = {
  grade: 0.8,
  comments: ["blah", "blah", "blah"],
};

// example method
function checkGrade(feedback) {
  console.log(`grade: ${feedback.grade}`);
  feedback.comments.forEach((comment) => {
    console.log(`${comment}`);
  });
  return true;
}
```

Now, we’ll set the deadline for _Sunday_ and modify the resolve statement to return a `feedback` object:

```js
resolve({ grade: 0.8, comments: ["blah", "blah"] });
```

You only want to check Lea once you’re sure there’s feedback; otherwise what's the point? Do you want to check Lea before the operation is complete? Absolutely not.

So, let’s handle the promise response only once there’s some sort of notification:

```js
poggieMustGrade({
  name: "Assignment 2",
  content: "some really cool code",
})
  .then((feedback) => {
    checkGrade(feedback);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Why is this so neat?

We only trigger the `checkGrade` method AFTER the assignment is graded. What's cooler? We can keep chaining methods as needed :)

Let’s say you get a notification once you’ve checked your grade. Here’s what that would look like:

```js
// another method
function sendPoggieDM(res) {
  if (res) {
    console.log("wow the student left me on read");
  }
}
```

Now, we can consume these responses quite elegantly like so:

```js
// updated chaining
poggieMustGrade({
  name: "Assignment 2",
  content: "some really cool code",
})
  .then((feedback) => {
    return checkGrade(feedback); // notice the return
  })
  .then((response) => {
    sendPoggieDM(response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Helpful tip

When you start creating promises, it’s easy to mess it up. This is where effective error handling in your catch block is important 👀

# Exercise 1

You are a student that needs to submit an essay. Once this essay is created, it should be reviewed, and then finally submitted on Lea once finished. How could you do this in JavaScript?

## Requirements

Each task is asynchronous and takes `3000` milliseconds to complete.

## Solution

```js
// Step 1: Create an Essay
function writeEssay(essay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Creating essay...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (essay.content) {
        resolve({ ...essay, id: 1, status: "created" });
      } else {
        reject("Failed to write essay lol");
      }
    }, 3000);
  });
}

// Step 2: Review the Essay
function reviewEssay(essay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Reviewing essay...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (essay.status === "created") {
        resolve({ ...essay, status: "reviewed" });
      } else {
        reject("Didn't Review lol");
      }
    }, 3000);
  });
}

// Step 3: Submit the essay
function submitEssay(essay) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Submitting Essay on Lea...");
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (essay.status === "reviewed") {
        resolve({ ...essay, status: "submitted" });
      } else {
        reject("Cannot submit essay: Omnivox is down again lol");
      }
    }, 3000);
  });
}

// Chaining the functions
writeEssay({ title: "Humanities Essay", content: "Wow this is an essay" })
  .then((essay) => reviewEssay(essay))
  .then((essay) => submitEssay(essay))
  .then((essay) => console.log("Essay status:", essay.status)) // Should print "submitted"
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

# Async / Await

Alright, so we know that `Promises` made handling asynchronous code a lot easier than the old "callback hell" approach. But when you start chaining too many promises, the code can still get messy and hard on our retinas

## Where does Async Await come in?

`async` and `await` make your code look cuter and easier to follow by letting you write asynchronous code in a more natural way, almost like regular synchronous code (but not quite)

- `async` 👉 A keyword used to declare a function that will handle asynchronous actions
- `await` 👉 A keyword used to pause the function until a promise is `resolve`d or `reject`ed

Let’s rewrite our earlier example with `async` and `await` so you can see the difference.

## Rewriting our example

The synchronous helper functions stay the same, but the `poggieMustGrade` function now becomes an `async` function:

```js
// Declare the function with "async"
async function poggieMustGrade(assignment) {
  const deadline = new Date("2024-11-03");

  // TODO - Simulate a wait period of 3 seconds instead of 3 days

  const today = new Date();
  if (today <= deadline) {
    return { grade: 0.8, comments: ["blah", "blah"] };
  } else {
    throw new Error(
      `Poggie slept thru her deadline and failed to grade your ${assignment.name}`
    );
  }
}
```

The `poggieMustGrade` function is marked as `async`, meaning we’ll need to `await` its result when we call it, like this:

```js
try {
  // "await" the response
  const feedback = await poggieMustGrade({
    name: "Assignment 2",
    content: "some really cool code",
  });
  // synchronous code can now be executed
  const response = checkGrade(feedback);
  sendPoggieDM(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message);
}
```

With `try` and `catch`, error handling is now much more sleek since you can wrap everything in one simple block.

## Can we have awaits inside of async functions?

Yeee 👉 If we need to simulate a delay inside `poggieMustGrade`, we can use `await` as follows:

```js
// Simulate a wait period of 3 seconds instead of 3 days
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
```

💡 Note: Once you have an `await` in a function, the function itself must be marked `async`.

# Promise.all()

With traditional promises, sharing resolved values across multiple steps in the chain could be tricky. `async` and `await` simplify that. HOWEVER, we still want to run multiple asynchronous tasks at the same time, _especially if they're not dependent on each other_. This is why we love `Promise.all`

## Common failures

Only await tasks sequentially if they depend on each other’s results. If they’re _independent_, you can use Promise.all to run them "concurrently" (e.g. at the same time)

For example, let's say I have the following `async` function:

```js
// simple function
const getIngredient = async (name) => {
  // walk to kitchen delay
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
  // return ingredient
  return Promise.resolve(name);
};
```

Now, here’s a function that uses this to make a sandwich:

```js
const badSandwich = async () => {
  const ing1 = await getIngredient("bread");
  const ing2 = await getIngredient("peanut butter");
  const ing3 = await getIngredient("jelly");
  return [ing1, ing2, ing3, ing1]; // 🥪
};
```

To make a sandwich:

```js
try {
  const food = await badSandwich();
  console.log(food);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message);
}
```

However, this is a `badSandwich` because each ingredient waits for the previous one. Let’s make a `betterSandwich` using `Promise.all`:

```js
const betterSandwich = async () => {
  const [ing1, ing2, ing3] = await Promise.all([
    getIngredient("bread"),
    getIngredient("peanut butter"),
    getIngredient("jelly"),
  ]);
  return [ing1, ing2, ing3, ing1]; // 🥪
};
```

Using `Promise.all` allows us to get each ingredient "concurrently", which makes the code faster and more efficient. In `betterSandwich` we’re taking full advantage of _non-blocking code_ and using the event loop effectively :^)

# Exercise 2

Take your Exercise 1 and transform it to work with `async` and `await`:

```js
// Step 1: Create an Essay
async function writeEssay(essay) {
  console.log("Creating essay...");
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
  if (essay.content) {
    return { ...essay, id: 1, status: "created" };
  } else {
    throw new Error("Failed to write essay lol");
  }
}

// Step 2: Review the Essay
async function reviewEssay(essay) {
  console.log("Reviewing essay...");
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
  if (essay.status === "created") {
    return { ...essay, status: "reviewed" };
  } else {
    throw new Error("Didn't Review lol");
  }
}

// Step 3: Submit the Essay
async function submitEssay(essay) {
  console.log("Submitting Essay on Lea...");
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
  if (essay.status === "reviewed") {
    return { ...essay, status: "submitted" };
  } else {
    throw new Error("Cannot submit essay: Omnivox is down again lol");
  }
}

try {
  // notice that each call relies on the previous call so we can't use "Promise.all"
  let essay = await writeEssay({
    title: "Humanities Essay",
    content: "Wow this is an essay",
  });
  essay = await reviewEssay(essay);
  essay = await submitEssay(essay);
  console.log("Essay status:", essay.status);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

# Real World Application

Let's take what we know about `fetch`ing data from an API and do this elegantly with `async` and await

Fo example, let's get a bunch of pokemons the bad way with the following syntax:

```js
const urls = [
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/squirtle",
];

const getData = async (url) => {
  const data = await fetch(url);
  return data.json();
};

// Step 1 - get a bunch of pokemon promises using map
const pokemonPromises = urls.map(async (v) => getData(v));

// Step 2 - resolve them all at once
console.log(await Promise.all(pokemonPromises));
```

That looks great but you need to be careful when you use `async` and `await` when working with `map` and `forEach`. It wont actually pause the function in this context:

```js
const pokemonPromises = urls.map(async (url) => {
  // not being paused like you may think
  const data = await fetch(url);
  return data.json();
});

// everything concurrently
console.log(await Promise.all(pokemonPromises));
```

Alternatively, if you want stuff to happen one at a time instead of concurrently, you can use the following (sleek) syntax:

```js
const pokemons = [];

const pokemonLoop = async () => {
  for await (const url of urls) {
    const pokemon = await fetch(url);
    pokemons.push(pokemon);
  }
};

await pokemonLoop();

console.log(pokemons);
```

## (not so) Fun Fact

async/await is the industry standard :^)

# Exercise 3

Using what you know about `fetch`, try to call the Pokemon API using the `async` / `await` way of doing things
