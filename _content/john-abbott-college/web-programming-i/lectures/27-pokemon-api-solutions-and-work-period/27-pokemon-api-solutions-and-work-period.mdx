# Pokemon Demo

I'm not including the code here because it looks way too close to Assignment 4, and I donâ€™t want you all tempted to just copy and paste my stuff ðŸ‘€

# How can I improve my code?

- Lazy loading the sprites
- Waiting for dom readiness
- Add async/await (what does this mean?? inside scoop next class)
- other stuff?

# Work Period

If you finished your assignment already, use this time to work on your other assignments cause i know y'all have like 3 due this week ðŸ‘€
