# Quick Recap

- What is Node.js? Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server
- What is nvm? nvm (Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows you to install, manage, and switch between different versions of Node.js
- What is npm? npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js
- What is the entry point of a node project? `index.js`
- What is the `package.json`? The `package.json` file contains metadata about the project
- What happens if i delete `node_modules` from my project? How do I get them back? Deleting the `node_modules` folder removes all installed packages. To restore them, run `npm install`

# Common Node.js problems and how to fix them

## Command not found

If you encounter the message:

```text
command not found
```

Here’s how to resolve it:

- Ensure that Node.js is installed properly: Use `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify
- Download [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [node](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Cannot run npm

If you see an error message like:

```text
cannot run scripts on this machine.
```

This might occur if you are using `PowerShell` in Visual Studio Code. To fix this, click the dropdown next to the `+` icon in the upper right corner of your terminal and select the `V` icon. Open either a `bash` or `zsh` terminal.

## Cannot Find Module

If you encounter this problem, it typically means you are trying to access a module that isn't installed. To fix this, run the following command in your project directory, and ensure your `package.json` is updated:

```bash
npm install module_name # but use the actual package name
```

If you still have import issues, your `node_modules` directory may be corrupted. In this case, delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall the modules:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules # clicking delete is also valid
npm install # fresh node modules 4 u
```

## The engine "node" is incompatible with this module

This error occurs when your current Node.js version does not meet the minimum version requirements specified by a package or dependency. To resolve this, check your `package.json` in the `engines` section:

```json
"engines": {
 "node": ">=14.0.0"
}
```

This indicates the version your project requires. Use `nvm` to switch to the specified version:

```bash
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

## Version Conflicts

Sometimes, certain packages may not work with newer versions of Node.js. To address this, use `nvm` to switch to an older version:

```bash
nvm install 12
nvm use 12
```

## npm install takes an eternity

If running `npm install` takes too long or fails due to network issues or dependency problems, you can speed things up by specifying a faster npm registry:

```bash
npm set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

n this context, a registry is a _centralized_ repository for JavaScript packages, whereas a CDN consists of a network of _distributed_ servers that deliver web content, such as jQuery.

# Exercise 1

As an exercise, set up a Node.js project and install `express` and `lodash`. Try to use `lodash` in your `index.js` by referring to the [official docs](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)

## Solution

Your `package.json` should look something like this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

And your `index.js` should look something like this:

```js
"use strict";

const _ = require("lodash");

const cats = [
  { user: "Charlie", age: 2 },
  { user: "Olive", age: 3 },
  { user: "Bill", age: 2 },
  { user: "Snuffles", age: 10 }, // only one older cat
];

const groupedCats = _.groupBy(cats, "age");

console.log(groupedCats);
```

# Modules

So far, we have learned how to import modules created by others, but what if we want to create our own?

## Getting Started

Imagine you have some JavaScript code contained in a single file. You can turn this code into a module by exporting it. This allows other files to use an `import` statement to include your file as a dependency.

## What is a module?

A file that exports some code.

## Why is this so cool?

Creating modules helps developers organize their code within projects and share it with others through package managers like `npm`

## How do you export your code?

The method you choose to export your code will determine how other files import it. There are two main approaches to creating a custom module:

- ESModules: This is the modern approach that uses `import`/`export`
- CommonJS: This is the traditional method that uses `require`/`module.exports`

We will cover both methods in this lecture.

# ESModules

The `import` syntax is part of the newer module system that follows the ECMAScript standard. It is natively supported by modern browsers and the latest versions of Node.js. While it may require some additional setup, it provides a clear and structured way to manage modules. Here’s how it works:

## Names

```js
// Named Export Statement
export const name = "value";

// Named Import Statement
import { name } from "...";
```

## Default

Default Export Statement:

```js
// Default Export Statement
export default "value";

// Default Import Statement
import anyName from "...";
```

## Rename

You can also rename exports during the export and import processes.

```js
// Rename Export Statement
export { name as newName };

// Rename Import Statement
import { newName } from "...";
```

## Lists

You can export and import multiple items, including renaming some of them.

```js
// List + Rename Export Statement
export { name1, name2 as newName2 };

// List + Rename Import Statement
import { name1 as newName1, newName2 } from "...";
```

By using these `export` and `import` patterns, you can manage dependencies in your projects, making your code easier to maintain.

# CommonJS

The `require` function represents the older module system, primarily used in earlier versions of Node.js. By default, Node.js treats files as CommonJS modules. Here’s how it works:

```js
// CommonJS Import Statement
const { name } = require("...");

// CommonJS Export Statement
module.exports = { name };
```

# When do I use which method?

If you are working with modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries, such as React or Vue, the recommended approach is to use `import` for modules. This is especially true for new projects, like those I work on.

If you are maintaining older projects or working on projects that need to be backwards compatible, then using `require` is the preferred method.

## Do I need to know both?

Yes. Throughout your career, you will likely encounter both methods.

# Modules in Practice

Building on `Exercise 1`, let’s create a new subfolder named utils where we will develop our own custom module called `customModule.js`. Your folder structure should look like this:

```md
node-app
├── node_modules
├── utils
│ ├── customModule.js
├── index.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
```

Now we can begin developing reusable code. Let's start with something simple that we often need to rewrite in our projects: text formatting.

_Fun fact: In the industry, you rarely start a Node project from scratch. Instead, you often build upon the work of many others, using existing libraries, frameworks, and modules_ :^)

## CommonJS Approach

In `customModule.js`, let’s add the following code:

```js
function caps(input) {
  if (!input || typeof input !== "string") {
    return null;
  }
  return input.toUpperCase();
}

module.exports = { caps }; // notice me
```

Next, in `index.js`, you can import the code like this:

```js
// notice me
const { caps } = require("./utils/customModule");

console.log(caps("ahhhhhhhhhhhh"));
```

When you run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node .
```

You should see the following output:

```text
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
```

Now, let’s take the more modern approach to modules

## ESModules

To inform Node.js that we want to use the modern approach, add the following line to your `package.json`

```json
{
  "type": "module", // notice me
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Node.js to interpret `.js` files as ESmodules. Now, we can modify `customModule.js` to use the modern `export` syntax:

```js
export function caps(input) {
  if (!input || typeof input !== "string") {
    return null;
  }
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

In `index.js`, import it using the following syntax:

```js
import { caps } from "./utils/customModule.js";

console.log(caps("ahhhhhhhhhhhh"));
```

This achieves the same functionality as before.

# Common Module problems and how to fix them

## Cannot use import statement outside a module

If you encounter an error message like this:

```text
import { myModule } from "some/link/to/myModule";
^^^^^^

SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

This indicates that you need to configure your `package.json` with the following line:

```json
{
  "type": "module" // add me to your package
}
```

## Cannot find module

If you see an error similar to this:

```text
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module 'node-app/some/link/to/myModule' imported from node-app/index.js
Did you mean to import ../utils/myModule.js?
```

Make sure that the file path in your import statement is correct. If your paths still do not work, ensure that your import statement ends with `.js`, like so:

```js
import { myModule } from "./utils/myModule.js"; // notice the extension
```

The extension is necessary for ESmodules in Node.js.

# Modules in the Real world

You can visit my [repo](https://github.com/elizabeth-poggie/elizabeth-poggie/tree/main/src/utils) to see how I created my own utilities if you are curious :^)

# Exercise 2

In this exercise, you will create some useful utilities.

First, set up the following folder structure:

```md
node-app
├── node_modules
├── utils
│ ├── textFormatters.js
├── index.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
```

Next, make the necessary changes in your `package.json` to use ES modules and create the following functions in `textFormatters.js`:

- `formatDateShort`: Takes a `dateString` as input and formats the date in short form.
- `formatDateLong`: Takes a `dateString` as input and formats the date in long form.

_Hint: You can convert the `dateString` into a `Date` object with the following code snippet_

```js
// dateString: 2024-09-30
const date = new Date(dateString);
```

You can read the documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString) to find out how to format the date correctly.

## Solution

Your `textFormatters.js` should be close to the following:

```js
export function formatDateShort(dateString) {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  const options = { month: "short", day: "numeric" };
  return date.toLocaleDateString(undefined, options); // Formats to Month Day
}

export function formatDateLong(dateString) {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  const options = { year: "numeric", month: "long", day: "numeric" };
  return date.toLocaleDateString(undefined, options); // Formats to 'Month Day, Year'
}
```

While your `index.js` should be close to this:

```js
import { formatDateShort, formatDateLong } from "./utils/textFormatters.js";

console.log(formatDateShort("2024-09-29"));
console.log(formatDateLong("2024-09-29"));
```
