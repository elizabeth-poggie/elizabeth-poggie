# Quick Recap

- What is Node.js?
- What is nvm?
- What is npm?
- What is the entry point of a node project?
- What is the `package.json`?
- What happens if i delete `node_modules` from my project? How do I get them back?

# Common Node.js problems and how to fix them

## Command not found

You might see the following:

```text
command not found
```

To fix this:

- Ensure that Node.js is installed properly: Use `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify
- Download [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [node](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Cannot run npm

You might get an error message on your machine that contains the following:

```text
cannot run scripts on this machine.
```

In this case, check to see if you are in `powershell` in your VScode. If this is the case, next to the `+` icon on the upper right hand corner of your terminal select the `V` icon and open up either a `bash` or `zsh`

## Cannot Find Module

When you run into this problem it's usually because you are trying to access something that isn't installed.

To fix this, run the below in your project and verify that your `package.json` has been updated to reflect these problems.

```bash
npm install module_name # but use the actual package name
```

If there is still an import problem at this point, your `node_modules` might have become corrupted. delete the `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` to resolve the problem.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules # clicking delete is also valid
npm install # fresh node modules 4 u
```

## The engine "node" is incompatible with this module

This occurs when the version of Node.js youâ€™re using does not meet the minimum version requirements specified by a package or dependency. TO fix this check your `package.json` and look for the following:

```json
"engines": {
 "node": ">=14.0.0"
}
```

This specifies the Node.js version you project expects. Using `nvm` (Node Version Manager) switch to this expected version:

```bash
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

## Version Conflicts

Some packages may unfortunately not work with newer versions of Node.js. To fix this, you need `nvm` again to switch to an older version of node:

```bash
nvm install 12
nvm use 12
```

## npm install takes an eternity

Sometimes running `npm install` takes an eternity or fails due to network or dependency issues. To fix this, you can actually specify a faster npm registry:

```bash
npm set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

In the context of npm, a registry is a _centralized_ repository that stores and distributes JavaScript packages. This differs from CDNs which are a network of _distributed_ servers that deliver web content (e.g. jQuery).
