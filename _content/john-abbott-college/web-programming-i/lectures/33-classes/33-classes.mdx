# Intro to Classes

have a prototype object associated to them
automatically in strict mode (use strict)
need to use new ClassName to call constructor

```js
class MyClass {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.field1 = param1;
    this.field2 = param2;
  }
}
```

## Accessing classes

You can access the prototype of an instance, using the property:

```js
// notice the double underscores on each side
__proto__;
```

## Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class using extends. How?

```js
super();
```

Where do we put `super`?

```js
class MyClass extends OtherClass {
  constructor(param1, param2, param3, param4) {
    super(param3); // inherit parent constructor
    super.fieldx = param4; //changes a field on the super
    this.field1 = param1; // add another field
    this.field2 = param2;
  }
}
```

## Getters and setters

```js
class MyClass {
  constructor(param1) {
    this.field1 = param1;
    this.secretField = 3;
  }
  get field() {
    return this.secretField;
  }
  set field(value) {
    this.secretField = value;
  }
}
```

Example usage:

```js
// init class
let theInstance = new MyClass(3);
// set field
theInstance.field = 34;
// get field
console.log(theInstance.field);
```

# Common class mistakes

## Setters Naming

Your code will yell at you if you try to make the below setter:

```js
set secretField(value) {
    this.secretField = value;
}
```

You will probably see this lovely thing logged to terminal:

```text
Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

Why is this happening? You are creating an infinite loop :^(

How do you fix this? Create a different field name OR name the internal field `_secretField` that you can reference.

## Getter naming

Likewise with getters:

```js
get secretField() {
    return this.secretField;
}
```

In this case you will get the following:

```text
Cannot set property secretField of # which has only a getter
```

How do you fix this? Again different field naming or if you must keep the same semantics, start the field name with `_`

## Setters without params

Naming the setters with the same name as internal fields:
