# Intro to Classes

have a prototype object associated to them
automatically in strict mode (use strict)
need to use new ClassName to call constructor

```js
class SomeClass {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.field1 = param1;
    this.field2 = param2;
  }
}
```

## Accessing classes

You can access the prototype of an instance, using the property:

```js
// notice the double underscores on each side
__proto__;
```

## Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class using extends. How?

```js
super();
```

Where do we put `super`?

```js
class MyClass extends SomeClass {
  constructor(param1, param2, param3, param4) {
    // Call the parent constructor
    super(param3, param4);

    // Using different field names to prevent conflicts
    this.fieldA = param1;
    this.fieldB = param2;
  }
}
```

Example Usage:

```js
const instance = new MyClass("extra1", "extra2", "base1", "base2");

console.log(instance.field1); // "base1" (inherited from SomeClass)
console.log(instance.field2); // "base2" (inherited from SomeClass)
console.log(instance.fieldA); // "extra1" (specific to MyClass)
console.log(instance.fieldB); // "extra2" (specific to MyClass)
```

# Class Methods

## Regular Methods

These are simply functions defined inside a class:

```js
class someClass {
  constructor(param1) {
    this.field1 = param1;
    this.secretField = 3;
  }
  async doStuff() {}
  doOtherStuff() {}
}
```

These guys can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

## Getters and Setters

These guys have a bit more restrictive syntax

```js
class SomeClass {
  constructor(param1) {
    this.field1 = param1;
    this.secretField = 3;
  }
  // getter
  get getField() {
    return this.secretField;
  }
  // setter
  set setField(value) {
    this.secretField = value;
  }
}
```

Example usage:

```js
// init class
let theInstance = new SomeClass(3);
// set field
theInstance.setField = 34;
// get field
console.log(theInstance.getField);
```

# Common Class mistakes

## Setter Naming

If you try to create the setter below, JavaScript will yell at you:

```js
set secretField(value) {
    this.secretField = value;
}
```

You’ll probably see this logged in your terminal:

```text
Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

What’s causing this? You’ve created an infinite loop because the setter keeps calling itself.

Solution? Use a different name for the internal field, such as `_secretField`, or something else completely different from the setter name. (so that the setter won’t trigger itself eternally)

## Getter Naming

Similar issues can happen with getters:

```js
get secretField() {
    return this.secretField;
}
```

In this case, you might see:

```text
Cannot set property secretField of # which has only a getter
```

How do you fix this? Similar strat the the setter error solution.

## async Getting and Setting

In JavaScript, getters and setters CANNOT be `async`. This is because getters and setters are expected to be synchronous by the JavaScript. SO, if you absolutely need an `async` method, make it just a regular method.

# Exercise 1 - Pokemans

Create a pokemon class with a getter and setter for it's `name` field as well as a regular method that fetches it's abilities.

## Solution

```js
class Pokemon {
  constructor() {
    this.name = null;
    this.abilities = null;
  }

  set pokemonName(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  get pokemonName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  // public Method to fetch stats asynchronously
  async fetchStats() {
    try {
      const url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${this.name}`;
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const pokemon = await response.json();
      this.abilities = pokemon.abilities.map((ability) => ability.ability.name);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("This messed up lol: ", error);
    }
  }
}
```

## Example usage

```js
const main = async () => {
  try {
    const myPokemon = new Pokemon();
    myPokemon.pokemonName = "pikachu";
    await myPokemon.fetchStats();
    console.log(myPokemon.abilities);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
};

main();
```
