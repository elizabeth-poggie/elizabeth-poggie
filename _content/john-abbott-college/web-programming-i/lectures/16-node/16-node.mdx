# Course updates

Test 1 will take place on _October 11_ as well as your Assignment 2 will be due that evening. This assignment was designed to practice all the concepts we have covered in class up until today so by doing the assignment you will be more than ready for the programming aspect of the test. The best way to learn how to code is to build something meaningful from scratch.

As for the theory, it will be similar difficulty to your quizzes.

# Introduction

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

I used this practically every day in my three years as a professional developer.

## Why learn it?

Its one of the most valuable skills you will need to learn as a full stack web developer. That is not going to change anytime soon because of how established it is industry.

## What is it?

It's not a programming language, but rather a runtime that allows you to write JavaScript on a server. When JavaScript first came along in the 1990s it was designed to run only in the browser as a simple scripting language.

In 2009, Node.js was released and it changed the landscape of web development by allowing programmers to master only 1 language to write a full stack application.

TLDR: It lets you write JS on the server.

## How was it made?

You don't really need to know the details as a beginner, however for the purposes of this class know that it runs the V8 JavaScript engine outside of the browser.

## How does it work?

You visit a URL on the internet that points to your server running Node.js. When the request is received we can use Node.js to handle the request and read a file from the server's file system. The server then generates an HTML file as well as carry out other operations and sends it back to the client.

## What can Node.js do?

Instead of listing out a bunch of use cases, I will show you how to set up a simple project using Node.js

# Getting Started

First let's navigate to VSCode and open up the terminal using `Ctrl + backtick` on Windows 🪟 and `Cmd + backtick` on Mac 🍎

## Installing Node.js

It's probably already installed on your system. To verify this, type:

```bash
node -v
```

This will log your node version to the console. If you get an error at this point, it means you don't have Node.js installed.

## NVM

To get started downloading node its time to set up Node Version Manager (`NVM`). Knowing this tool even if you have node installed will be useful to have in case you need to switch between different versions of node.

This happens quite often in industry.

Follow the instructions for your system here:

- MacOS / Linux: [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Windows: [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

To verify your installation, run the following:

```bash
nvm -v
```

Once installed, we can start having fun :^)

# REPL Mode

This is a mode that lets you play with JavaScript directly in the terminal. Type `node` into the terminal and you should see the following pop up:

```text
Welcome to Node.js v20.10.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
>
```

Now type:

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

However most of the time we want to writer JavaScript that lives in an actual file. to exit this mode hit `Ctrl+C` twice.

# Our First Node App

Create an empty folder in VSCode called `node-app`. Inside this folder create a file `index.js`, this is the default entry point of all our node applications.

```md
node-app
├── index.js
```

Add the following to your `index.js` to make sure your project has been set up right:

```js
console.log("Hello World ✨");
```

And to run your app head over to the terminal and in the root folder and run the following:

```bash
node .
```
