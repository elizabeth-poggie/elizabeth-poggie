# Course Outline

## INTRODUCTION

The Web Programming I course provides the student with the front-end tools and techniques required to become proficient as a JavaScript developer. The student will learn JavaScript to an intermediate level, seeing topics such as asynchronous programming, Fetch, Promises, and Async/Await. Object Oriented Programming will be used with JavaScript and HTML Canvas. Industry standard tooling will be used to make the developer workflow more efficient. Source code will be organized using source control software.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

Competency 00SU: Develop transactional Web applications.

- For transactional Web applications: reservations, registrations, collaboration, inventory management, e-commerce, etc.
- For new applications and applications to be modified
- Based on design documents
- Using images
- Using issue tracking and version control procedures

## TEACHING METHODS

This course consists of _75 hours_ of scheduled lectures and lab work. In addition, each student will be required to do _30 hours_ of personal study that includes research, personally booked computer time and work at home. Léa, the course management system within Omnivox, will be used in this course.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

We all have our own ways of learning, and I respect what works best for you. However, I've noticed over time that students who skip every class often struggle to pass, as many of the activities I plan are closely tied to the course material. If you're sitting at a 58 and need a grade bump to pass and avoid repeating the course, students who consistently show up and put in the effort in person are more likely to receive that support.

## OTHER POLICIES

Refer to the doc on Lea if you're keen on using your free time to read legal jargon

## CHEATING

Don't do it. I know when you do it. I know if you are lying. I am required by contract to report it, and just like how you're interested in earning your degree, I'm interested in maintaining my current employment :^)

## GRADING

Leadership skills do not go unnoticed and I’ll boost your assignment grades if you show them. For details on how I grade assignments, please refer to the "Assignment Rubric". It’s based on criteria developed by a Director of Engineering & Infrastructure to evaluate professional engineers. The aim is to prepare you for success at JAC, in university, or in the corporate world.

# Office Hours

- Monday, 2:30pm - 5:00pm
- Thursday, 1:30pm - 3:00pm
- Friday, 12:00pm - 1:00pm

# How to get in touch

The response time depends on which platform you reach out on:

- P237 👉 Less than 1 min
- Teams 👉 >5 mins to 1 day
- MIO 👉 2 to 3 business days
- elizabeth.poggie@johnabbott.qc.ca 👉 3 to 5 business days
- Instragram 👉 Never.

# What to expect

With my background in running large-scale events, I try to design in-class activities to feel like a gamified version of the actual material. My goal is for you to have fun doing them as much as I have fun organizing them.

# Two Truths and a Lie

We’ll go around the room, and each person will share their name along with three statements about themselves—two truths and one lie. The group will then need to guess which statement is the lie.

# Survey

Once you’ve completed the [survey](https://forms.gle/L1jE42QvevTHvRGz5), you’re free to leave early. See you tomorrow :)
