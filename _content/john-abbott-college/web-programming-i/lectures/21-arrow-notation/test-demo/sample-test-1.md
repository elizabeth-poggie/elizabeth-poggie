# Sample Test 1

The test is a mix of short answer, multiple choice, short coding questions, and a debugging question. Similar structure to your first test in User Interfaces, this time it will take place in purely in VSCode so you don't need to context switch between Moodle and pieces of paper, so your focus is on just one framilliar output that simulates a practical coding interview.

Questions have been sourced from previous teachers here at JAC and developers on the hiring committees of multiple companies across montreal.
