# Quick Recap

- Modules
- Lazy Loading
- Servers
- Unit Testing
- VScode Extensions such as Quokka.js and Jest Test Runner
- Arrow notation

## Arrow notation example

```js
// Traditional
const greet = function (name) {
    console.log("Hey there, " + name + "!");
  },

// Arrow notation
const greet = (name) => console.log("Hey there, " + name + "!");

// calling it looks the same for either function syntax
greet("yeet");
```

## Example from like a week ago

Building on the previous exercise from like a week ago, I'll go through it step by step:

```js
var student = {
  name: "Your name",
  id: 12345,
  rScore: 90000,
  greet: function (name) {
    console.log("Hey there, " + name + "!");
  },
  reminder: function () {
    console.log(`Did you know that you have a Test Friday?`);
  },
  calculateRScore: function (bonus) {
    // at this fictitious school, the r score only goes up
    this.rScore += bonus;
  },
};

student.greet();
student.reminder();
student.calculateRScore(42);
console.log(student.rScore);
```

## Solution

```js
const student = {
  name: "Your name",
  id: 12345,
  rScore: 90000,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hey there, ${this.name}!`);
  },
  reminder: () => console.log("Did you know that you have a Test Friday?"),
  calculateRScore(bonus) {
    // At this fictitious school, the rScore only goes up
    this.rScore += bonus;
  },
};
```
