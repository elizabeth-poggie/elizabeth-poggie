# Quick Recap

Let's go over step by step on how to create our own static photo server

## Exercise 2 - Last Class

Set up a server using `http-server` with `index.html` as the entry point. Find 3 hi-res images from the internet and save them in your `public` folder.

Next, measure how long it takes to load your page when using `loading="lazy"` on the images. What happens when you remove this attribute? Test the loading time when you simulate a _Slow 4G_ connection using Chrome DevTools.

## Solution

Your folder structure should look like this:

```md
myServer
├── public
│ ├── image1
│ ├── image2
│ ├── image3
├── node_modules
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
```

Your package.json should look like this:

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^14.1.1"
  }
}
```

In your `index.html`, include the following code:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cool Cats</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="./public/image1.jpg" loading="lazy" />
    <img src="./public/image2.jpg" loading="lazy" />
    <img src="./public/image3.jpg" loading="lazy" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Then by navigating to the `Network` Tab, look for your `localhost` and take note of the load time in each scenario. You will have to _Disable Cache_

# Unit Testing

## Why Care?

In industry, for every feature you develop, you will also be required to make your own unit tests to guarantee your feature's

## Getting Started

Install Jest as a development dependency to our Exercise2. Notice the `--save-dev` flag below:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Now configure your `package.json` with a new `test` script:

```JSON
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
  // other stuff
}
```
