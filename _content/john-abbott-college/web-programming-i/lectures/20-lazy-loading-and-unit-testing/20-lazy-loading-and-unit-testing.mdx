# Quick Recap

Let’s review the steps to create your own static photo server.

## Exercise 2 - Last Class

Set up a server using `http-server` with `index.html` as the entry point. Find 3 high-res images and save them in your `public` folder.

Next, measure how long it takes to load your page when using `loading="lazy"` on the images. Remove this attribute and observe the changes.

## Solution

Your folder structure should look like this:

```md
myServer
├── public
│ ├── image1
│ ├── image2
│ ├── image3
├── node_modules
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
```

Your `package.json` should look like this:

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^14.1.1"
  }
}
```

In your `index.html`, use this code:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cool Cats</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="./public/1.jpg" loading="lazy" />
    <img src="./public/2.jpg" loading="lazy" />
    <img src="./public/3.jpg" loading="lazy" />
  </body>
</html>
```

After setting this up, navigate to the `Network` tab in your browser’s developer tools. Look for your `localhost` and note the loading times in each scenario. Remember to _Disable Cache_ to observe the different loading times.

# Unit Testing

## Why Care?

In the industry, for every feature you develop, you are also required to write corresponding unit tests. This basically ensures that your work isn't trash.

## Which Library should you use?

For this class, we will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a powerful and popular testing library.

![Jest](./assets/jest.png)

Although Jest was developed by Facebook and is often associated with React, it can test ANY JavaScript code, including applications built with Angular and Vue.

## What makes Jest neat?

Jest does more than just run your tests; it offers a variety of valuable features, including:

- Snapshot Testing 👉 Automatically captures snapshots of your HTML to track changes.
- Coverage Reports 👉 Provides built-in code coverage reports to highlight any edge cases you may have missed.
- Mocking Capabilities 👉 Includes a built-in mocking library that allows you to simulate objects outside your test's scope.
- Docs 👉 Jest has comprehensive and user-friendly documentation.
- Speed 👉 Jest runs tests incredibly quickly and the process is even faster when you add the VSCode extensions :^)

TLDR: Jest tests your code and it does it well.

# Getting Started

Let’s set up a new project and install Jest as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest # notice the flag
```

Next, update your `package.json` to include a new `test` script:

```JSON
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
  // other stuff
}
```

# Creating Tests

Create a folder called `tests` in the root of your project:

```md
myServer
├── tests
├── ...
```

Inside the `tests` folder, create a test file called `demo.test.js`:

```js
// demo.test.js

describe("Math operations", () => {
  it("should add 1 + 1", () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
  });
});
```

In the code above, notice the `describe` and `it` syntax. what do these keywords mean?

- `describe` 👉 This function is used to define a test suite. You can group related tests together under meaningful titles, such as `Math operations`, `Assignment1`, `Assignment2`, etc.
- `it` 👉 This function is used to define an individual test case. Each case should specify a particular functionality you want to test, such as `add`, `subtract`, `checkWinner`, `validateForm`, etc.

# Running Tests

To run your tests, simply run:

```bash
npm test
```

Jest will automatically locate your test files, such as `demo.test.js`, and execute all the defined tests within them. If everything is fine, you should see output similar to this in your console:

```bash
myDemoServer % npm test

> test
> jest

 PASS  tests/demo.test.js
  Math operations
    ✓ should add 1 + 1 (1 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.304 s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Troubleshooting

If your tests fail for any reason, it's likely that you are using a version of Node lower than 14. In that case, switch to the required Node version with the following command:

```bash
nvm use 20
```

or ensure the default node version is always reasonable:

```bash
nvm alias default 20
```

# Expanding our Example

Let’s expand our test suite to cover additional math operations. Here are some examples to consider that demonstrate `Jest`'s options

```js
// demo.test.js

describe("Math operations", () => {
  describe("Math operations", () => {
    // equals
    it("should add 1 + 1", () => {
      expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
    });

    // not equals
    it("should multiply 2 * 3", () => {
      expect(2 * 3).not.toBe(7);
    });

    // this should fail
    it("should subtract 2 - 1", () => {
      expect(2 - 1).toBe(42);
    });
  });
});
```

If any of your tests fail, `Jest` will inform you of the exact line causing the issue, making it easier to identify and fix the problem (either in the test or in your code lol)

# Jest Autocompletion

To enable auto-completion for Jest in your code editor, configure it to recognize Jest's methods. Start by installing the type definitions for Jest:

```bash
npm install @types/jest --save-dev
```

Next, create a `jsconfig.json` file in your root directory:

```md
myServer
├── ...
├── jsconfig.json
├── ...
```

Then, add the following JSON configuration:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "checkJs": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "jest": ["node_modules/jest"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Now, when you write a test case and type `expect`, you will enjoy the benefits of auto-completion :^)

```js
expect("stuff").
```

Happy coding ❤️

# Handy VSCode Extensions

## Jest Essentials

There's a useful [Jest extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) that makes your life easier with features like inline test results and improved integration with the editor. Why is this so neat?

- User Friendly 👉 Testing becomes as simple as clicking a button.
- Speed 👉 In industry, your `.test.js` will become long and beefy, so normally you don't want to waste time running the entire test suite with `npm test` rather target a specific tests.

## JavaScript Essentials

[Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) provides real-time feedback and displays the output of your JavaScript code directly within the editor. It has a bunch of neat features such as:

- Inline Execution Output 👉 See the results of your code ASAP
- Live Code Coverage 👉 Monitor your code coverage ASAP
- Error Highlighting 👉 Identify errors in your code ASAP

## Restart

After adding these extensions, remember to restart your editor to activate them.

# Using VsCode Extensions

## Jest

Above each of your test cases (written with `it`) and test suites (written with `describe`), you will see options like this:

```md
Run | Debug
```

Select one of these options, what happens?

## Quokka.js

To get started with Quokka.js, create a blank JavaScript file. To activate `Quokka.js`, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` for windows 🖥️, or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac 🍎 to open the command palette and search for and select `Quokka.js: Start on Current File`

Now, if I write the following code:

```js
const demo = "demo";
console.log(demo);
```

What happens?

# Exercise 1

Take your code from `Assignment1` and move the `checkWinner()` function to a separate file named `cookieCompetition.js`. Next, create a test suite for your `cookieCompetition.js` and write a test case for the `checkWinner` function using Jest.

After adding the extensions, how does this make your life easier?

## Solution

Your `cookieCompetition.js` should look something close to this:

```js
function checkWinner(player1, player2) {
  let player1Total = player1.startingCookies;
  player1.cookiesPerRound.forEach(function (cookies) {
    player1Total += cookies;
  });

  let player2Total = player2.startingCookies;
  player2.cookiesPerRound.forEach(function (cookies) {
    player2Total += cookies;
  });

  if (player1Total > player2Total) {
    return `${player1.name} Wins!`;
  } else if (player1Total < player2Total) {
    return `${player2.name} Wins!`;
  } else {
    return "it's a tie!";
  }
}

module.exports = { checkWinner }; // notice me
```

Your `cookieCompetition.test.js` should look close to this:

```js
// cookieCompetition.test.js
const { checkWinner } = require("../scripts/cookieCompetition");

describe("Assignment 1", () => {
  it("check winner - returns player1 as the winner", () => {
    const player1 = {
      name: "Jim",
      startingCookies: 10,
      cookiesPerRound: [5, 8, 7],
    };
    const player2 = {
      name: "Pam",
      startingCookies: 15,
      cookiesPerRound: [4, 4, 4],
    };

    expect(checkWinner(player1, player2)).toBe("Jim Wins!");
  });
});
```
