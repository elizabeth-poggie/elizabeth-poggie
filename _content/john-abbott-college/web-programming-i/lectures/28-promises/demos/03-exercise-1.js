/**
 * Here's what the promise should do:
 *
 * - If the number is even, the promise should resolve with the message “yes.”
 * - If the number is odd, the promise should reject without any message.
 *
 * When using this function, add a `.then` block to log the result to the console, and a `.catch` block to log “the number is odd” if the promise is rejected.
 * Finally, test your function by calling it with a few different numbers to see how it handles each case.
