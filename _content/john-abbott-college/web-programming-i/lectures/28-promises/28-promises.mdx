# Intro to Promises

# What is a Promise?

It is the result of an asynchronous operation , a result that we donâ€™t have yet.

It is a "promise" that you will get a result (eventually)

## Why is this cool?

It allows you to write out what should happen with the result before you have the result and move on

## Why Promises?

We have event listener callbacks tho?

Well promises are a great way to "chain" things. For example: - when async operation A finishes pass on info in a call to B, - when B finishes, pass info and call operation C.

It let's you avoid "callback hell"
