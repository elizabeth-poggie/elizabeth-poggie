# Variable Declaration Continued

In our last class, we explored the various ways to declare variables in JavaScript. The best practice is to use `const` by default, reserving `let` for cases where reassignment is necessary. While `var` can be useful when you need function-scoped variables, it is less common in modern JavaScript.

```js
const x = "I am the best";
let y = "use me in loops and such";
var z = "Why are you using me ðŸ‘€";
```

# Scope

In our previous class, we discussed the difference between function scope and block scope. The lifetime of a JavaScript variable begins when it is declared. Local variables exist only within the function or block where they are defined and are removed when the function or block completes, meaning they are no longer accessible.

Understanding the scope of variables helps in managing and organizing code effectively, ensuring that variables are used correctly within their intended context.

```js
// a globally scoped variable
const x = 42;
function example() {
  // a locally scoped variable
  const x = 24;
  console.log(x);
  // end of y's lifetime
}
example();
// end of x's lifetime
```

When trying to access an identifier, the JavaScript Engine will first look in the current function:

```js
const x = 42;
function example() {
  const x = 24;
  console.log(x); // 24 will print because it is in the current function
}
example();
```

If it does not find the identifier in the current scope, JavaScript will search for it in the next outer scope. This process continues until it reaches the global scope.

```js
const x = 42;
function example() {
  const y = 24;
  console.log(x); // 42 will print because it is declared globally
}
example();
```

Global identifiers can introduce risks, so it is important to understand when their use is appropriate. Examples of global identifiers include variables, functions, or objects that can be accessed from any part of your code. Being mindful of their scope helps prevent potential conflicts and unintended behaviors.

# Global Identifiers

## Constants or Configuration Values

Global identifiers are useful for values that should remain consistent throughout your entire application and are unlikely to change, such as environment variables or configuration settings. For example:

```js
const BASE_URL = "https://example.com/";
```

It is a best practice to use uppercase letters with underscores to declare these constants, making it clear that they are intended to never change.

## Libraries

When you are developing or utilizing a library or framework that needs to make certain functions or variables accessible across different parts of your application, global identifiers can be necessary. For example:

```js
window.myLibrary = {
  greet: "hallo",
};
```

In this case, global identifiers ensure that the libraryâ€™s functions and variables are available throughout your application, allowing different parts of your code to interact with them.

## What does this look like in action?

For an example of defining constants, take a look at where I set up my constants ðŸ‘‰ [NOTES_BASE_FOLDER](https://github.com/elizabeth-poggie/elizabeth-poggie/blob/main/pages/notes/index.tsx#L16). This setup ensures that the notes I create are specifically tied to John Abbott College.

## The Risks

Despite their usefulness, global identifiers should generally be avoided. Hereâ€™s why:

- Conflict Risk ðŸ‘‰ Global identifiers can lead to conflicts, especially in larger projects or when integrating multiple libraries.
- Security Concerns ðŸ‘‰ They can be accessed and modified by any script on the page, which might create security vulnerabilities.
- Testing Challenges ðŸ‘‰ They can complicate unit testing because their state persists across different tests. This will be covered in Web 2.

Returning to my code, I use the following constant to track my base folder:

```js
const NOTES_BASE_FOLDER = "john-abbott-college";
```

If I switch to a new job at another college or want to include notes from my undergraduate studies, Iâ€™ll face the challenge of refactoring a lot of code and deprecating a variable. While this approach works for my current small codebase and limited user base, it could become a significant issue in the next five years as the project grows.

## Best Practices

- Minimize Global Identifiers ðŸ‘‰ Use global identifiers sparingly. Instead, prefer local scope, functions, or closures to manage your variables and functions. This approach helps keep your code organized and prevents potential conflicts.
- Leverage Module Systems ðŸ‘‰ Modern JavaScript supports module systems that confine variables and functions to the module level. However this concept is outside the scope of this lecture.

# Hoisting

## What is it?

Hoisting is a concept in JavaScript that allows variables and functions to be used before they are explicitly declared in the code. Hereâ€™s an example from our last class:

```js
var x = 42;
function example() {
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 undefined
  var y = 24;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // 42 24
}
example();
```

In this example, only the declarations of variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, not their initializations. As a result, `y` is `undefined` when it is first accessed because its value is assigned later in the code.

## What can be hoisted?

Only variables declared with `var` are hoisted. Variable declaration is not hoisted when a variable is declared with `let` or `const`

## What are more examples of hoisting?

This code WILL NOT run:

```js
test = "hi"; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'test' before initialization
let test = "bye"; // no hoisting here
console.log(test);
```

This code WILL run and print `"bye"`:

```js
test = "hi"; // no error ðŸ‘‰ variable declared using var is hoisted
var test = "bye"; // no hoisting here
console.log(test);
```

This code WILL run:

```js
console.log(test); // undefined ðŸ‘‰ only the declaration is hoisted
var test = "bye";
console.log(test); // bye
```

This code WILL NOT run:

```js
console.log(test); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'test' before initialization
let test = "bye"; // no hoisting here
console.log(test);
```

# Objects

JavaScript objects are a data structure that allow you to store collections of related data and more complex entities. They are made up of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a symbol) that is associated with a value, which can be of any data type, including functions or another object.

```js
const student = {
  firstName: "Arthur",
  lastName: "Dent",
  id: 1234567,
  greeting: function () {
    return "don't panic";
  },
};
```

Notice how they are comma delimitated.

## Accessing Properties

```js
// You can access it like you may be familiar with arrays
student["firstName"];

// dot notation is also fair game
student.firstName;

// to invoke a function its like this
student.greeting();
```

## Property Conventions

- Never use quotation marks
- use `camelCase` naming conventions
- Never start with a number, include spaces, and use hyphens

```js
// trash example
var car = {
  "model name": "tesla",
};
console.log(car.model name); // Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list

// good example
const betterCar = {
  modelName: "tesla",
};
console.log(betterCar.modelName); // tesla

```

# Exercise 1

Create a breakfast object to represent the following menu item.

```text
The Lumberjack - $9.95
eggs, sausage, toast, hashbrowns, pancakes
```

The object should contain properties for the `name`, `price`, and `ingredients`

## Solution

Here is the JavaScript Object:

```js
const breakfast = {
  name: "The Lumberjack",
  price: 9.95,
  ingredients: ["eggs", "sausage", "toast", "hashbrowns", "pancakes"],
};
```

and here is how you format it so that it prints nicely:

```js
console.log(
  `${breakfast.name} - $${breakfast.price} \n
  ${breakfast.ingredients.toString()}`
);
```

# Accessing properties from within an object

Within an object method, the `this` keyword refers to the object itself, allowing you to access other properties and methods of the object.

Going back to our breakfast example, let's say I wanted to add an ingredient to the array. What would that look like?

```js
const breakfast = {
  name: "The Lumberjack",
  price: 9.95,
  ingredients: ["eggs", "sausage", "toast", "hashbrowns", "pancakes"],
  addIngredient: function (newIngredient) {
    this.ingredients.push(newIngredient); // notice the `this` keyword
  },
};
```

And when we run the below, we will get the updated object:

```js
// ofc coffee MUST be included
breakfast.addIngredient("coffee");

// now print again
console.log(
  `${breakfast.name} - $${
    breakfast.price
  } \n${breakfast.ingredients.toString()}`
);
```

However we are already duplicating code here, that's bad practice. Let's make our solution more concise:

```js
const breakfast = {
  name: "The Lumberjack",
  price: 9.95,
  ingredients: ["eggs", "sausage", "toast", "hashbrowns", "pancakes"],
  addIngredient: function (newIngrediant) {
    this.ingredients.push(newIngrediant);
  },
  print: function () {
    // create a print function
    console.log(
      `${this.name} - $${this.price} \n${this.ingredients.toString()}`
    );
  },
};
```

and now to see any updates to our object we simply just need to run:

```js
breakfast.print();
```

# Exercise 2

Create an object called `instagramProfile`. This object should include the following three properties:

- Your `name`
- the number of `friends` you have
- an array of `messages` you've posted as strings

Additionally, the object should contain two functions:

- `addFriend()` that increases the friend count by 1
- `removeFriend()` that decreases the friend count by 1

## Solution

```js
const instagramProfile = {
  name: "Poggie",
  friends: 80,
  messages: [
    "HELLO",
    "Is this really what's popular these days?",
    "I feel like a boomer",
  ],

  addFriend: function () {
    this.friends++;
  },

  removeFriend: function () {
    if (this.friends > 0) {
      this.friends -= 1;
    }
  },
};
```
