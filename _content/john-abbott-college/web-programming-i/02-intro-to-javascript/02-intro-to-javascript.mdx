# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level interpreted language that is supported by all modern web browsers, used by 92% of websites.

It is also probably one of the most hated.

# WTFJS

JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.

At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.

If you want to learn about more of the crazy examples in JavaScript and how they work, you can see the full list here: https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs

## However this is a quick Summary

Why? JavaScript is what brings your website to life

# History time

Christmas 1990 came with the birth of the internet. In the early 90s Netscape took up about 80% of the market share and browsers needed to become more dynamic. At the time they turned to the trendy Java language but they quickly didnt like it just as many do and instead came up with something else.

## How long do you think it took to create JavaScript?

10 days.

It was intended to be a simple scripting language and the creater, Eich, couldn't have predicited how almost every website today uses it.

## The evolution of naming

Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript (Java popular) -> JScript (Marketing Team) -> ECMAScript (ES6, ES7, ES2017)

## What is ECMA?

Well, imagine taking one of your hackathon projects and giving it to the entire world to tinker with. Things are inevitably going to break everyone is going to come up with fun ways to bring it to the extremes. We needed a way to keep chaos to a minimum and thats what ECMA was developed.

Think of it as a book to develop standards and technical reports to facilitate and standardize the use of information communication technology. Like your course outline that you probably only glance at once and the "Terms of conditions" that you quickly scroll through, you can imagine that people people didn't full respect these conventions.

## Miscrosoft being Microsoft

Well Netscape wenton to become obsolete and got taken over by Microsoft's very popular internet explorer. In the early 90s IE went on to control 90% of the market share and decided to do its own thing. They made up it's own extensions for JavaScript.

And thats why we are paying for the consequences of this decision almost 2 decades later as this created a lot of fragmentation withg the language that we need to factor in to our sites when supporting some of these legacy browsers.

## The 2000s

Here was the time of the Rise and fall of the 4rth iteration of ECMA. The rise and fall of ActionScript. And the rise and fall of Flash.

Think of this as the dark ages of JavaScript.

## Modern JavaScript

With the release of Google Chrome and the V8 Engine came the JavaScript that we know today.

# Compiled vs Scripting
