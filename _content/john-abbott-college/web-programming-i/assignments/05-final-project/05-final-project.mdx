There is a lot more freedom in this project however because you can quite literally do anything, I want to make sure that you aren't about to have a miserable time trying to achieve the impossible.

ðŸ’¡ Note: This is worth `5%` and acting as your "Assignment 5". Feel free to submit earlier tho.

# Part 2 - Getting started

This project was designed to build on everything you have done on previous assignments so be sure to read over your constructive feedback prior to submitting

## Repository

- Create a private GitHub repository with the name of your game.
- Invite @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator.
- Add a `README.md` that contains the below sections:
  - Project name: Your inspiration written in your own words (not ChatGPTs)
  - Designs: All three figma designs

Now create a champion class that extends the player class. Every champion (character) has unique stats that define how they perform in combat. The champion class has the below attributes:

- Character name
- Character skin
- An array of abilities
- Health (HP)
- Speed - Determines which character attacks first
- Mana/Energy (optional) - used to cast _magical_ abilities
- Other attributes you may find useful. Have fun :^)

# Part 4

# Rubric

For my general grading approach check out the rubric [here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric) However, for this project I am specifically looking at:

- JavaScript functionality requirements
- Page quality and user experience
- All code follows best practices, quality, tight logic, and does not show glaring duplication
- Naming conventions make sense
- You use the modern `async`/`await`/ You should NEVER use `.then()` in the project
- Creativity: BONUS up to 10%

# Submission

In a `.txt` file add a link to your _private_ GitHub repository on which you have added _only me_ @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator and the Git commit Id code of _your final commit_ for the project. Submit this on to Lea.
