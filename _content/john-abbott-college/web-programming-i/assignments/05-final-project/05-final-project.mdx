# Goal

You are the founder of a fast-paced battle royale game and today you are in charge of making your vision come to life.

# Part 1 - Crafting your vision

## Requirements

For this project you can call _any_ API you desire with the below general requirements:

- At least 2 different APIs to generate stats and skins for playable characters
- At least 3 HTML files described below

This project was designed to build on everything you have done on previous assignments so be sure to read over the constructive feedback prior to submitting

## Figma

Before getting started, take time to develop your idea using tools that professional designers use in industry. Create designs for the following screens:

- Character Selection:
  - User input (player name)
  - Character options (ATLEAST 8)
  - Game duration using a slider (measured in minutes)
  - Skin selection (ATLEAST 2 unique to each character)
  - Player 1 and Player 2 slots that get populated upon character pick
  - a start game button
- Gameplay
- Game Over

# Part 2 - Getting started

## Repository

- Create a private GitHub repository with the name of your game.
- Invite @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator.
- Add a `README.md` that contains the below sections:
  - Project name: Your inspiration written in your own words (not ChatGPTs)
  - Designs: All three figma designs
  - APIs: The selected APIs and their associated docs
  - Resources: The resources you used for the project with links

# Part 3 - Character selection

## Character Requirements

Create a player class that has the below properties:

- Player name
- Player age

Now create a champion class that extends the player class. Every champion (character) has unique stats that define how they perform in combat. The champion class has the below attributes:

- Character name
- Character skin
- An array of abilities
- Health (HP)
- Mana/Energy (optional) - used to cast _magical_ abilities
- Speed (optional) - Determines which character attacks first
- Other attributes you may find useful. Have fun :^)

# Part 4

# Rubric

For my general grading approach check out the rubric [here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric) However, for this project I am specifically looking at:

- JavaScript functionality requirements
- Page quality and user experience
- All code follows best practices, quality, tight logic, and does not show glaring duplication
- Naming conventions make sense
- You use the modern `async`/`await`/ You should NEVER use `.then()` in the project
- Creativity: BONUS up to 10%

# Submission

In a `.txt` file add a link to your _private_ GitHub repository on which you have added _only me_ @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator and the Git commit Id code of _your final commit_ for the project. Submit this on to Lea.
