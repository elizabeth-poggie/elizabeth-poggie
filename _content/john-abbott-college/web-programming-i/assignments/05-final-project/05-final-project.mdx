# Part 1 - Crafting your Vision

## Requirements

For this project you can call _any_ API you desire with the below general requirements:

- At least 2 different APIs to generate stats and skins for playable characters
- At least 4 HTML files described below

If this freedom is spooky for you, feel free to use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) or [tvmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) that we have seen in class. What do you mean you can turn movie information into playable characters? You can. Use the below People endpoint:

- URL: /search/people?q=:query
- Example: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=shia

## Figma

Take time to develop your idea using tools that professional designers use in industry. To get started:

- Open up [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Play around with their [templates](https://www.figma.com/templates/web-design-inspiration/)

## Design Requirements

_index_

- User input for player 1 and player 2 names and ages

_Character Selection_

- Game duration using a slider (measured in minutes)
- Skin selection (ATLEAST 2 unique to each character)
- Player 1 and Player 2 slots that get populated upon character pick
- A start game button

Gameplay

# Submission 1 (5%)

By `December 1rst, 2024 @ 11:59pm` latest on Lea Submit the following `.zip` folder containing:

- All your designs exported from Figma as images.
- Your APIS choices

There is a lot more freedom in this project however because you can quite literally do anything, I want to make sure that you aren't about to have a miserable time trying to achieve the impossible.

# Part 2 - Getting started

This project was designed to build on everything you have done on previous assignments so be sure to read over your constructive feedback prior to submitting

## Repository

- Create a _private_ GitHub repository with the name of your game.
- Invite @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator.
- Add a `README.md` that contains the below sections:
  - Project name: Your inspiration written in your own words (not ChatGPTs)
  - Designs: All three figma designs
  - APIs: The selected APIs and their associated docs
  - Resources: The resources you used for the project with links

# Part 3 - Index

# Part 4 - Character selection

## Character Requirements

Create a player class that has the below properties:

- Player name
- Player age

Now create a character class that extends the player class. Every character has unique stats that define how they perform in combat and should contain the below properties:

- Character name
- Character skin
- An array of abilities
- Health (HP)
- Speed - Determines which character attacks first
- Mana/Energy (optional) - used to cast _magical_ abilities
- Other attributes you may find useful. Have fun :^)

# Part 5 - Gameplay

# Rubric

For my general grading approach check out the rubric [here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric) However, for this project I am specifically looking at:

- JavaScript functionality && HTML
- Page quality and user experience
- All code follows best practices, quality, tight logic, and does not show glaring duplication
- Clear naming conventions
- Usage of the modern `async`/`await` to perform ALL asynchronous operations. You should NEVER use `.then()` in this project.
- Creativity: BONUS up to 10%

# Submission 2 (20%)

In a `.txt` file add a link to your _private_ GitHub repository on which you have added _only me_ @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator and the Git commit Id code of _your final commit_ for the project. Submit this on to Lea.
