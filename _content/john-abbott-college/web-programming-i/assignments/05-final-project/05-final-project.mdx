# Goal

You are the founder of a fast-paced battle royale game and you need to create a proof of concept to secure funding for your project.

# Part 1 - Crafting your Vision

## Requirements

For this project, you are free to call _any_ API of your choice, but your work must meet the following criteria:

- Use at least two different APIs to generate stats and skins for playable characters
- Include at least _three HTML_ files as described in the design requirements below

If this freedom is spooky for you, feel free to use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) or [tvmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) that we have seen in class. For example, you could turn TV information into playable characters using the following "People" endpoint:

- URL: /search/people?q=:query
- Example: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=shia

## Figma

To kick off your project, start by using Figma, a professional design tool commonly used in the industry:

- Open [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Play around with their [templates](https://www.figma.com/templates/web-design-inspiration/) to help you structure your ideas.

## Design Requirements

Your designs should cover the following four screens:

- _index_
  - Input fields for Player 1 and Player 2 names and ages.
- _Character Selection_
  - Display at least _8 characters_ to choose from
  - Include a [slider](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) to select the game duration (in minutes)
  - Provide skin options, with at least 2 unique skins per character
  - Create slots for Player 1 and Player 2 that populate when characters are chosen
  - Include a "Start Game" button
- _Gameplay_ ðŸ‘‰ Choose one of the following UI options:
  - Option 1: A PokÃ©mon-style battle interface using radio buttons for selection.
  - Option 2: A Super Smash Bros-style interface using HTML Canvas.

# Submission 1 (5%)

By `December 1rst, 2024 @ 11:59pm`, submit the following via Lea as a `.zip` folder:

- Exported images of all your designs from Figma
- A `.txt` file listing the APIs you have chosen

ðŸ’¡ Note: This project gives you A LOT of creative freedom, but with freedom comes responsibility. You have the flexibility to quite literally do anything, but make sure you choose a _scope_ that is achievable within the given timeline. Consequently, for this first submission I will be making sure that you aren't about to have a miserable time trying to achieve the impossible.

# Part 2 - Getting started

This project was designed to build on everything you have done on previous assignments so be sure to read over your constructive feedback prior to getting started.

## Repository

- Create a _private_ GitHub repository with the name of your game.
- Invite @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator
- Add a `README.md` that contains the below sections:
  - Project name: Your inspiration written in your own words (not ChatGPTs)
  - Designs: All three figma designs
  - APIs: The selected APIs and their associated docs
  - Resources: The resources you used for the project with links

# Part 3 - Index

## Player Name Requirements

- Make sure

# Part 4 - Character selection

## Character Requirements

Create a player class that has the below properties:

- Player name
- Player age

Now create a character class that extends the player class. Every character has unique stats that define how they perform in combat and should contain the below properties:

- Character name
- Character skin
- An array of abilities
- Health (HP)
- Speed - Determines which character attacks first
- Mana/Energy (optional) - used to cast _magical_ abilities
- Other attributes you may find useful. Have fun :^)

# Part 5 - Gameplay

# Rubric

For my general grading approach check out the rubric [here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric) However, for this project I am specifically looking at:

- JavaScript functionality && HTML
- Page quality and user experience
- All code follows best practices, quality, tight logic, and does not show glaring duplication
- Clear naming conventions
- Usage of the modern `async`/`await` to perform ALL asynchronous operations. You should NEVER use `.then()` in this project.
- Creativity: BONUS up to 10%

# Submission 2 (20%)

In a `.txt` file add a link to your _private_ GitHub repository on which you have added _only me_ @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator and the Git commit Id code of _your final commit_ for the project. Submit this on to Lea.
