# Rubric

For my general grading approach check out the rubric [here](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric) However, for this project I am specifically looking at:

- JavaScript functionality requirements
- Page quality and user experience
- Creativity: BONUS up to 10%
- All code follows best practices, quality, tight logic, and does not show glaring duplication
- Naming conventions make sense

# Submission

In a `.txt` file add a link to your _private_ GitHub repository on which you have added _only me_ @elizabeth-poggie as a collaborator and the Git commit Id code of _your final commit_ for the project. Submit this on to Lea.
