# Overview

- Worth: This lab will count towards the Assignment portion of your final grade at `7%`
- Due: `September 21 @ 2:00am` - I recommend submitting by `September 20 @ 9:00pm` to ensure good sleep, however for those who thrive under last-minute pressure, you have until the deadline later that evening ðŸ‘€
- Submission: Upload a `.zip` file containing your work folder to LEA. This folder should include a single `HTML` file with all JavaScript in the appropriate location.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# Grading Criteria

Refer to my general approach here: [Assignment Rubric](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric)

For this assignment, I will specifically be assessing:

- Inputs: The function correctly takes in the specified inputs.
- Logic: The functionâ€™s logic produces the expected results across all possible scenarios with minimal complexity.
- Outputs: The function returns the expected output.
- Naming: All names (functions, variables, parameters) should be meaningful, non-abbreviated, and clearly convey their purpose.

# Q1 - Cookie Clicker Challenge

`Worth 20 marks`

## The Pitch

Taking inspiration from your Intro to Web development class, youâ€™ve decided to create a competitive Cookie Clicker game using JavaScript. The game consists of 3 rounds, and only the player with the highest cookies per second (CPS) will emerge victorious.

## Your Task

Create a JavaScript function that determines the winner of a 3-round cookie-clicking competition. Your function should take in two objects, each representing a player in the competition.

## Object Spec

Each of the two objects should have exactly three properties:

- Player Identifier: A property that identifies the player (e.g., name).
- Starting Cookies: The number of cookies the player begins with (an integer).
- Cookies Per Round: An array containing the number of cookies clicked in each of the 3 rounds. The first number in the array represents the cookies clicked in round 1, the second in round 2, and the third in round 3.

## Function Spec

Your function should identify the player who collected the most cookies in total after the 3 rounds.

## Additional details

- Each roundâ€™s cookies are added to the playerâ€™s total.
- In case of a tie, return "It's a tie!" or another identifier of your choice.

I will invoke and evaluate your function. You are welcome to include sample objects you used to test your function.

## Example IO

Given the sample data:

- Jim ðŸ‘‰ Starting cookies: 10; Cookies clicked per round: [5,8,7]
- Pam ðŸ‘‰ Starting cookies: 15; Cookies clicked per round: [6,7,9]

The function would output:

```text
Winner: Pam ðŸŽ‰
```

This is because:

- Jim's total cookies = 10 + (5 + 8 + 7) = 30
- Pam's total cookies = 15 + (6 + 7 + 9) = 37

Pam has a higher CPS rate compared to Jim, and therefore has more cookies.

# Q1 - Anti-Social Networking

`Worth 30 marks`

## The Pitch

You are a founder of an obscure social networking platform that suggests friends based on shared enemies.

```cs
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"
```

Inspired by this ancient proverb, your task is to implement the core features needed to attract funding for your questionable project.

## Your Task

Create a JavaScript function and a user object with inner methods. Your function should take in two user objects.

## Object Spec

Both user objects should have properties for:

- Username: A string representing the user's online handle.
- Join year: The year the user joined the social network.
- Last active year: The last year the user was active (you can choose how to represent someone who is still active).
- Location code: A string representing the user's location (e.g. postal code).
- List of enemies: An array of usernames representing the user's known enemies on the network.

The `FIRST` user object should contain the following methods (inside the object):

- Method 1: Takes in the join year and the last active year of another user and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the two users were active on the social network during the same period.
- Method 2: Takes in another user object and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the two users share any mutual enemies (i.e., if both users have at least one username in their enemies list).

## Function Spec

The main function should determine if the two users are likely to have become allies due to their mutual enemies by returning:

- `null` if the two users are not likely to have interacted online due to lack of mutual enemies or differing active periods.
- A `string` indicating a potential alliance if they share at least one mutual enemy (e.g., "Potential allies due to mutual enemies").

## Additional details

I will invoke and evaluate your function with your provided user objects.

## Example IO

Given the sample data:

- Jim ðŸ‘‰ Joined in 2020; Last active in 2023; Location Code: "SCR"; Enemies: ["Dwight", "Charles Miner"]
- Pam ðŸ‘‰ Joined in 2021; Last active in 2024; Location Code: "SCR"; Enemies: ["Dwight"]

The function would output:

```text
Result: Potential allies due to mutual enemies
```

This is because Jim and Pam share `Dwight` as a common enemy. If Jim and Pam had no mutual enemies or their active periods didnâ€™t overlap, the function would return `null`.
