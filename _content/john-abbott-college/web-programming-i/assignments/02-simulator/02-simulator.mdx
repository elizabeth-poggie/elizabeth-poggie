## The Pitch

Peeking the interest of an [Angel Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor), your Assignment 1 has successfully secured the funding it needs to take your project to the next level.

Using HTML Forms, you will create a cookie-themed strategy game inspired by the indie tabletop horror game [Buckshot Roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckshot_Roulette). Your version is intended to reach a wider audience, so it will need to be family-friendly and align with [College Policies](https://johnabbott.qc.ca/the-college/official-documents/)
