# Doughboy Roulette

Peeking the interest of an [Angel Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor), your Assignment 1 has successfully secured the funding it needs to take your project to the next level.

Using HTML Forms, you will create a cookie-themed strategy game inspired by the indie tabletop horror game [Buckshot Roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckshot_Roulette). Your version is intended to reach a wider audience, so it will need to be family-friendly and align with [College Policies](https://johnabbott.qc.ca/the-college/official-documents/).

# Gameplay

The game consists of three rounds. _For this assignment, you will only need to implement one round._

## Starting a Round

At the beginning of a round, each player is given 3 cookies and a set of 4 items that provide various advantages throughout the game. The computer-controlled Dealer then fills an empty tin with 3 real cookies and 2 fake cookies in a random order

## Turns

During their turn, the player chooses to either give a cookie to the Dealer or attempt to eat a cookie from the tin. If the player selects a cookie and it is fake, either the player or the Dealer loses one of their starting cookies. If the cookie is real, the player can either eat it and attempt to eat more cookies or forfeit the tin to the Dealer, allowing the Dealer to take their turn.

## Ending a Round

The round concludes when any player runs out of their starting cookies. If the tin is emptied and neither player has lost all their cookies, the Dealer refills the tin with a new selection of real and fake cookies.

## Special Items

- A magnifying glass, which reveals the cookie currently at the top of the tin
- A coupon to Maxi, which restores one starting cookie
- A milkshake, which safely clears the tin of a fake cookie without any negative consequences and skips the player's turn
- An iPad, which distracts the opponent causing them to skip their next turn.

# HTML Specifications

## Assignment Structure

## Starting Screen

Before starting the game, the player submit the following form:

- Player Name:
- Player Age:

Do not allow the browser to submit the form unless the user has provided a name and a valid age. If the user inputs trash, a user-friendly message should appear.

Once the user enters a valid input, they should be redirected to the "Game Play" screen

## Gameplay Screen

At the top of the screen both players stats should be listed with the following information:

- Player name
- Starting cookies
- The list of items they have available to them
- A small icon that identifies which player's turn it is.

In the middle of the screen there should be a tin of cookies

At the bottom of the screen, there should be a list of the available options to the user. They can choose to:

- Use an item, represented as a list of radio buttons. Players typically can use only one item per turn.
- Pass or eat a cookie from the tin, represented as a list of radio buttons.
