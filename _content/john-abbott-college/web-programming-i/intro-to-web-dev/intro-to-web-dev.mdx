# Course Outline

Posted on Lea, however going to also put here.

## INTRODUCTION

The Web Programming I course provides the student with the front-end tools and techniques required to become proficient as a JavaScript developer.

## TEACHING METHODS

This course consists of _75 hours_ of scheduled lectures and lab work. In addition, each student will be required to do _30 hours_ of personal study that includes research, personally booked computer time and work at home. LÃ©a, the course management system within Omnivox, will be used in this course.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

We all have our own ways of learning, and I respect what works best for you. However, I've noticed over time that students who skip every class often struggle to pass, as many of the activities I plan are closely tied to the course material. If you're sitting at a 58 and need a grade bump to pass and avoid repeating the course, students who consistently show up and put in the effort in person are more likely to receive that support.

## OTHER POLICIES

Refer to the doc on Lea if you're keen on using your free time to read legal jargon

## CHEATING

Don't do it. I know when you do it. I know if you are lying. I am required by contract to report it, and just like you're interested in earning your degree, I'm interested in maintaing my current employment :^)

## GRADING

Leadership skills do not go unnoticedâ€”Iâ€™ll boost your assignment grades if you show them. For details on how I grade assignments, please refer to the rubric. Itâ€™s based on criteria developed by a Director of Engineering & Infrastructure to evaluate professional engineers. The aim is to prepare you for success at JAC, in university, or in the corporate world.
