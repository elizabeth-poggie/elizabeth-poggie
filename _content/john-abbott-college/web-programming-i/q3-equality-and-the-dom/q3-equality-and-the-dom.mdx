# Question 1

Which of these equality checks will log true in the console? Half of the answers listed below are correct 👀

- ❌ console.log( "4" === 4 );
- ❌ console.log( "four" === 4 );
- ✅ console.log( 4 === 4 );
- ❌ console.log( 4 = 4 );
- ✅ console.log( "4" == 4 );
- ✅ console.log( "four" === "four" );

## Why?

- `4 === 4` 👉 strict equality, same value and type
- `"4" == 4` 👉 loose equality with type coercion
- `"four" === "four"` 👉 strict equality, same value and type

# Question 2

When strict equality is performed in JavaScript, the two compared values:

- ❌ must be booleans.
- ✅ must be of the same data type, or the result will be false.
- ❌ are coerced to the same type before comparing values.
- ❌ must be of the same data value, or the result will be false.

## Why?

Strict equality (`===`) compares both the VALUE and the TYPE. If the values have DIFFERENT types, they are considered not equal _regardless_ of their actual values. While the values must be the same for strict equality to return true, _it’s the data type that must also be the same_. The statement is not fully correct without mentioning the data type requirement.

# Question 3

Which options below best describe the DOM? Select all that apply

- ❌ available to the JavaScript as a string in a variable called document
- ✅ an object of the loaded HTML page
- ❌ a function you can call to change elements of a loaded web page.
- ✅ created by the browser
- ❌ an object you must create in your JavaScript code before you could use it
- ❌ a data structure stored as JSON that can be accessed through the browser's API

## Why?

The DOM is an object model of the HTML page created by the browser, allowing JavaScript to interact with the structure of the document.

## Detailed Reasoning

What the DOM is:

- ✅ an object of the loaded HTML page 👉 The DOM represents the structure of the HTML page as a tree of objects. Each element, attribute, and text in the HTML is represented as a node in this tree.
- ✅ created by the browser 👉 The browser automatically creates the DOM when it loads an HTML document. This allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the page.

What the DOM is not:

- ❌ available to the JavaScript as a string in a variable called document 👉 The DOM is not a string but an object model. The document object provides access to the DOM, but it is not a string.
- ❌ a function you can call to change elements of a loaded web page 👉 The DOM is not a function. It is a model that allows you to interact with the document structure. Methods and properties of the document object (like getElementById or querySelector) allow you to change elements, but the DOM itself is not a function.
- ❌ an object you must create in your JavaScript code before you could use it 👉 The DOM is automatically created by the browser, and you don’t need to create it manually in JavaScript.
- ❌ a data structure stored as JSON that can be accessed through the browser's API 👉 The DOM is not stored as JSON. It is a hierarchical tree structure of objects representing the HTML elements, accessible through the browser's API, but not in JSON format.

# Question 4

Given the following HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="first">Priority</h1>
    <script>
      const retrieved = document.getElementsByTagName("h1");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To change the value shown in the h1 element, the following code should be added:

- ❌ retrieved.innerHTML = "New Priority" ;
- ✅ retrieved[ 0 ].innerHTML = "New Priority";
- ❌ retrieved.innerHTML( "New Priority" );
- ❌ retrieved[ 0 ].innerHTML( "New Priority" );

## Why?

To modify the content of the `<h1>` element, you need to access the specific element within the `HTMLCollection` (`retrieved[0]`) and then set its `innerHTML` property to the new value.

# Question 5

Given the below function, what would make it "pure"?

```js
function doStuff(a, b) {
  // add code here
}
```

- ❌ return 420 + b;
- ❌ return Math.random() + a ;
- ❌ console.log("Hello World");
- ✅ return (a + b) + " what is poggie doing????";

## Why?

A "pure" function in JavaScript (or any other programming language) is a function that meets the below requirements:

- DEPENDS ONLY on its input.
- ALWAYS returns the same output given the SAME inputs.
- Is STATELESS and doesn't modify external state OR rely on external variables.

## Detailed Reasoning

What "pure" functions are:

- ✅ `return (a + b) + " what is poggie doing????";` 👉 This option is pure because it consistently returns a result based on the inputs `a` AND `b` and does not modify any external state or produce side effects.

What "pure" functions are not:

- ❌ `return 420 + b;` 👉 This option is not purely determined by the inputs alone and only factors in `b` while ignoring `a`
- ❌ `return Math.random() + a;` 👉 This option is not pure because `Math.random()` generates a random number each time it is called
- ❌ `console.log("Hello World");` 👉 This option is not pure because it is ignoring `a` and `b`
