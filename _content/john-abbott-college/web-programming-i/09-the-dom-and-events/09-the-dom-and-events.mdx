# Recap

Always use the "strict" equality in JavaScript for comparison.

Why? When using `===` we are comparing the `type` and `value` at the same time.

On the other hand, if you use `==` you are performing a "loose" equality and JavaScript is performing a _type coercion_. What does this mean? Two values are compared only AFTER attempting to convert them into a common type.

```js
console.log(34 === 20 + 14); // true
console.log(34 === true); // false
console.log(34 == true); // false
console.log(1 == true); // true
console.log("3" === 3); // false
console.log("3" == 3); // true
console.log("3" === 12 < 11); // false
console.log("0" == 12 < 11); // true
```

Note: while i'm not going to test you on `==` black magic, it's important to remember the difference between `==` and `===` when it comes to comparison.
