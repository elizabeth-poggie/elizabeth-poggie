# Question 1

Why is it good to validate a form using JavaScript in the browser?

- ✅ It improves user experience by catching errors before the form is submitted, reducing the need for unnecessary server requests
- ❌ It ensures that the form data is only validated after it is sent to the server.
- ❌ JavaScript validation is more secure than server-side validation.
- ❌ It automatically stores the form data

## Why?

By catching errors client-side, we reduce the need for unnecessary server requests, which can save time and improve the user experience.

# Question 2

Which of the following components defines where the form data should be sent when submitted?

- ❌ id
- ✅ action
- ❌ onsubmit
- ❌ method

## Why?

This attribute defines the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted:

```html
<!-- Notice the action below -->
<form action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <!-- ... -->
</form>
```

# Question 3

What is the BEST way to prevent the default behavior of a form submission using JavaScript?

- ✅ Use the `stopPropagation()` method in the form's submit event handler
- ❌ Return `true` from the submit event handler
- ❌ Return `false` from the submit event handler
- ❌ Call the `event.preventDefault()` method within the submit event handler

## Why?

`event.preventDefault()` is the best practice and the correct method to prevent the default behavior of any event, including form submission in JavaScript. This stops the form from submitting (by default) and allows you to handle the form's data and apply custom form validation, without reloading the page.
