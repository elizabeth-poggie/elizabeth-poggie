# Question 1

Why is it good to validate a form using JavaScript in the browser?

- ✅ It improves user experience by catching errors before the form is submitted, reducing the need for unnecessary server requests
- ❌ It ensures that the form data is only validated after it is sent to the server.
- ❌ JavaScript validation is more secure than server-side validation.
- ❌ It automatically stores the form data

## Why?

By catching errors client-side, we reduce the need for unnecessary server requests, which can save time and improve the user experience.
