# Question 1

Why is it good to validate a form using JavaScript in the browser?

- ✅ It improves user experience by catching errors before the form is submitted, reducing the need for unnecessary server requests
- ❌ It ensures that the form data is only validated after it is sent to the server.
- ❌ JavaScript validation is more secure than server-side validation.
- ❌ It automatically stores the form data

## Why?

By catching errors client-side, we reduce the need for unnecessary server requests, which can save time and improve the user experience.

# Question 2

Which of the following components defines where the form data should be sent when submitted?

- ❌ id
- ✅ action
- ❌ onsubmit
- ❌ method

## Why?

This attribute defines the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted:

```html
<!-- Notice the action below -->
<form action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <!-- ... -->
</form>
```

# Question 3

What is the BEST way to prevent the default behavior of a form submission using JavaScript?

- ✅ Use the `stopPropagation()` method in the form's submit event handler
- ❌ Return `true` from the submit event handler
- ❌ Return `false` from the submit event handler
- ❌ Call the `event.preventDefault()` method within the submit event handler

## Why?

`event.preventDefault()` is the best practice and the correct method to prevent the default behavior of any event, including form submission in JavaScript. This stops the form from submitting (by default) and allows you to handle the form's data and apply custom form validation, without reloading the page.

# Question 4

What does the following jQuery code do?

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  /* code here */
});
```

- ❌ It prevents the default action of a form submission
- ✅ It ensures the code runs only after the DOM is fully loaded
- ❌ It waits for the entire page to load, including images
- ❌ It runs the code immediately when the script is ready

## Why?

This ensures that the JavaScript inside the function will run only once the DOM is fully loaded and is "`ready`" to be accessed. Specifically, it waits for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to trigger.

# Question 5

Which statement correctly describes the difference between `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events?

- ❌ `DOMContentLoaded` waits for all images to load, while load does not
- ❌ `load` event fires first, followed by `DOMContentLoaded`
- ✅ `DOMContentLoaded` is triggered by the `document`, while load is triggered by the `window`
- ❌ They serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably

## Why?

- `DOMContentLoaded` is triggered by the `document` when the HTML has been fully loaded and parsed, meaning the DOM is `ready()` for interaction. It doesn't wait for external resources like images or stylesheets to finish loading.
- The `load` event is triggered by the `window` and fires only after the entire page has loaded, including all images, stylesheets, and other external resources.
