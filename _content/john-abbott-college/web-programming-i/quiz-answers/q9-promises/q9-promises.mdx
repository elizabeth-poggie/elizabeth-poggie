# Question 1

I'm working on an AJAX request to dynamically add information to my page. Which of the following statements are true for an AJAX request?

Select 2 answers:

- ✅ I am causing the triggering of an HTTP request
- ✅ I am writing code in JavaScript
- ❌ All parts of the operation will occur synchronously
- ❌ I am telling the browser to submit a form to a web server

## Why?

AJAX requests are used to communicate with servers through HTTP _using JavaScript_. These requests can fetch data (e.g., `GET` requests), send data (e.g., `POST` requests), or perform other operations without requiring a page reload.

# Question 2

Match up the concept with its description

- Completing an instruction before moving on to the next instruction 👉 Synchronous Execution
- A way to dynamically change loaded web pages with information that is obtained asynchronously 👉 AJAX
- A function that performs an asynchronous HTTP request 👉 `fetch`
- An object that represents the future result of an asynchronous operation 👉 Promise

# Question 3

Given the following JavaScript code:

```js
let test = (inValue) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(inValue > 100));
  });
};
let theThing = test(5);
```

What will the variable `theThing` hold as soon as the last line is run?

_For this question you may not use Chrome DevTools_

- ❌ `5`
- ❌ `undefined`
- ❌ `5000`
- ✅ `Promise { <pending> }`
- ❌ `false`
- ❌ `Promise`

## Why?

The function `test(5)` creates _and immediately returns a Promise_. However, this promise has not yet been resolved because the `setTimeout` callback hasn't been executed yet. So, the promise is still in the _pending_ state.

# Question 4

Which of the following is `true` about chaining promises?

- ✅ Each `.then()` method runs only after the previous promise is resolved
- ❌ `.catch()` must always be at the start of a promise chain
- ❌ Only one `.then()` method can be chained to a promise
- ❌ Using `.then()` makes the code synchronous

## Why?

it do be that way when chaining promises

# Question 5

What does the `fetch` function return in JavaScript?

_For this question you may not use Chrome DevTools_

- ❌ An HTML document
- ❌ JSON data directly
- ✅ A Promise representing the response of the request
- ❌ The status of the HTTP request

## Why?

The `fetch` function in JavaScript returns a `Promise` that resolves to the response object of the HTTP request!!
