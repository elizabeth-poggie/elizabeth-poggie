# Question 1

I'm working on an AJAX request to dynamically add information to my page. Which of the following statements are true for an AJAX request?

Select 2 answers:

- I am causing the triggering of an HTTP request
- I am writing code in JavaScript
- All parts of the operation will occur synchronously
- I am telling the browser to submit a form to a web server

## Why?

# Question 2

Match up the concept with its description

- Completing an instruction before moving on to the next instruction ðŸ‘‰
- A way to dynamically change loaded web pages with information that is obtained asynchronously ðŸ‘‰
- A function that performs an asynchronous HTTP request ðŸ‘‰
- An object that represents the future result of an asynchronous operation ðŸ‘‰

# Question 3

Given the following JavaScript code:

```js
let test = (inValue) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(inValue > 100));
  });
};
let theThing = test(5);
```

What will the variable `theThing` hold as soon as the last line is run?

For this question you may not use Chrome DevTools

- `5`
- `undefined`
- `5000`
- `Promise { <pending> }`
- `false`
- `Promise`

## Why?
