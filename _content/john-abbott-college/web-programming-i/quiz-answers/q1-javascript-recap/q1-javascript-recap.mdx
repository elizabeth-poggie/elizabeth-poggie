# Question 1

A program can be considered to be written in a scripting programming language when:

- ‚ùå A compilation step is required before it can be run.
- ‚úÖ The code is usually interpreted rather than compiled.
- ‚ùå It is only written in JavaScript.
- ‚ùå It contains ancient characters.

## Why?

A scripting programming language typically refers to a language where the code is executed directly, often by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code first. This allows for faster development, as you can run the code immediately without waiting for a compilation step. However, in languages like JavaScript, this can sometimes lead to issues going unnoticed until later, when unexpected `undefined` behavior starts to appear due to overlooked errors.

# Question 2

Given this JavaScript code:

```js
var test = [12, ["hi", 12], "hi"];
```

What would `test[1]` resolve to?

- ‚ùå `undefined`
- ‚ùå `"hi"`
- ‚úÖ `["hi", 12]`
- ‚ùå `12`
- ‚ùå `["hi"]`

## Why?

In JavaScript, arrays are "zero-indexed", meaning that the index of the first element is `0`, the second element is `1`, and so on.

# Question 3

Given this HTML page loaded in a browser:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      function test() {
        count = 12;
        tries = 2;
        console.log("Hi");

        if (count >= 13) {
          console.log("Hi");
        } else if (tries <= 3) {
          console.log("Hi");
        }
      }

      test();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

How many times will "Hi" be logged to the console of the browser?

- ‚ùå Once
- ‚úÖ Twice
- ‚ùå Continuously
- ‚ùå Never

## Why?

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ üëâ When the `test` function is called, the first `console.log("Hi");` is executed unconditionally, so "Hi" is logged once at this point.
- 0Ô∏è‚É£ üëâ The if condition checks if `count >= 13`. Since count is `12`, this condition is `false`, so the first `console.log("Hi");` inside this block is NOT executed.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ üëâ The else if condition checks if tries `<= 3`. Since tries is `2`, this condition is `true`. Therefore, the second `console.log("Hi");` inside this block is executed.

```js
function test() {
  count = 12;
  tries = 2;
  // step 2 - print "HI" x1Ô∏è‚É£
  console.log("Hi");

  // step 3 - skip
  if (count >= 13) {
    console.log("Hi");
    // step 4 - print "HI" x2Ô∏è‚É£
  } else if (tries <= 3) {
    console.log("Hi");
  }
}

test(); // step 1 - invoke test
```

# Question 4

Given this JS written in a CodePen

```js
const x = 24;
function example(y) {
  console.log(x + " " + y);
  var x = 24;
  var x = y;
  console.log(x + " " + y);
}
example(42);
```

What will print to console?

- ‚úÖ 'undefined 42' '42 42'
- ‚ùå '24 42''42 42'
- ‚ùå SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
- ‚ùå '24 42''24 42'

## Why?

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

```js
const x = 24;
function example(y) {
  console.log(x + " " + y); // Line A
  var x = 24;
  var x = y;
  console.log(x + " " + y); // Line B
}
example(42);
```

## Line A

When `example(42)` is called, the code inside the function executes. Before executing, JavaScript performs variable declarations (but not initializations) due to hoisting. So the `var x` declarations are "hoisted" to the top of the function, but their assignments are not.

- The `const x` outside the function does not affect the `var x` inside the function.
- The `var x` inside the function is declared but not yet initialized, so it is `undefined` at this point.

Therefore, `console.log(x + " " + y);` prints `undefined 42`

## Line B

The `var x` declaration is initially assigned the value `24`, but it is then immediately reassigned the value of `y`, which is `42`. This reassignment works without issues because var allows re-declaration and re-initialization within its scope. As a result, `console.log(x + " " + y);` prints `42 42`.

# Question 5

What is the official name of the standard JavaScript implements?

- ‚úÖ ECMAScript
- ‚ùå JavaScript
- ‚ùå Mocha
- ‚ùå ES6
- ‚ùå JScript

## Why?

ECMAScript is the official name of the standard that JavaScript implements. The ECMAScript specification defines the core features and rules for scripting languages like JavaScript. JavaScript is the name of the programming language that follows to the ECMAScript standard, but it is not the name of the standard itself. As we discussed in previous lectures, many of the names you‚Äôve encountered are marketing decisions rather than technical specifications. `#promotional-propaganda`
