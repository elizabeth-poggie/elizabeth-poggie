# Question 1

Which of these behaviors would constitute cheating or plagiarism when working on Assignment 1 for this course? üëÄ

- ‚ùå Telling your friend to Google JavaScript function syntax when they tell you they are stuck.
- ‚ùå Convincing your classmates that 'paper, scissors, rock' does sound better than the wrong version.
- ‚úÖ Group programming with a class mate or two.
- ‚úÖ Asking your granny, a JavaScript expert, to do your assignment, promising video call minutes in exchange.
- ‚úÖ Screen sharing to show your friend what you did for the second function.
- ‚úÖ Sending a friend part of your assignment code for inspiration.

## Why?

Guiding someone to find information independently helps them learn and understand the material better and suggesting a bad solution over the wrong solution does not involve cheating or plagiarism, it's more about preferences.

# Question 2

Select the best JavaScript Object that represents a student. The only correct answer is:

```js
const student = {
  firstName: "Arthur",
  lastName: "Dent",
  id: 42,
  courses: ["Web 1", "Databases", "Programming 3"],
  contactInfo: {
    email: "42@johnabbott.net",
    mobile: "(424) 242-4242",
  },
  introduce: function () {
    return `Hi, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};
```

## Why?

All other options contain a formatting error or the improper type for the given property.

# Question 3

When is it generally ok to use global variables in JavaScript?

- ‚ùå When you need to share data across multiple functions or modules and limit variable access to a specific scope.
- ‚úÖ When the variable needs to be accessed and modified by any function throughout the entire program, but should be used sparingly to avoid potential conflicts or unintended behavior.
- ‚ùå When the variable is used in a small, isolated part of the program to avoid scope issues.
- ‚ùå When you want to prevent other parts of the program from modifying the variable by making it accessible everywhere.

## Why?

Overusing global variables can lead to conflicts and unintended behavior because they are accessible from anywhere in the code, which can make debugging and maintaining the code painful.

# Question 4

Given the following CodePen

```js
var test = {
  maximumMark: 15,
  numberOfQuestions: 5,
  weightOfEachQuestion: 3,
  description: "Test 1",
  testMark: 0,
  updateMark: function (markForOneQuestion) {
    // code inserted here
  },
};
```

Which code snippet added as the body of the updateMark function is the best and would result in a console log of 5 when the file is loaded on a browser?

```js
return markForOneQuestion; // ‚ùå
```

```js
this.testMark = this.testMark + markForOneQuestion;
return this.testMark; // ‚úÖ
```

```js
testMark = testMark + markForOneQuestion;
return this.testMark; // ‚ùå
```

```js
return this.testMark; // ‚ùå
```

## Why?

- `return markForOneQuestion;` ‚ùå This snippet returns the value of markForOneQuestion, but does not update testMark.
- `this.testMark = this.testMark + markForOneQuestion; return this.testMark;` ‚úÖ correct answer :^)
- `testMark = testMark + markForOneQuestion; return this.testMark;` ‚ùå This snippet attempts to use `testMark` without `this`.
- `return this.testMark;` ‚ùå This snippet only returns the current value of `testMark`

# Question 5

What is the main difference between var and let in JavaScript?

- ‚ùå Variables declared with `var` are block-scoped, while variables declared with `let` are only globally-scoped.
- ‚ùå A common best practice is to avoid using `let` and instead prefer `var` whenever possible.
- ‚ùå Both `var` and `let` are hoisted and initialized with undefined.
- ‚úÖ Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared in the same scope, while variables declared with `let` cannot.

## Why?

- `var`: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside a function. This means that they are accessible throughout the entire function or global context. `var` allows re-declaration within the same scope, which can lead to _trash code and bugs_.

- `let`: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined. This helps to prevent issues related to variable re-declaration in the same scope and allows for _more predictable and manageable code_.
