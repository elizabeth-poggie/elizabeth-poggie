# Question 1

Which of the following is the correct way to write an arrow function that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum? Select one or more:

```js
// ❌
(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

```js
// ❌
function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

```js
// ✅
(a, b) => a + b;
```

```js
// ✅
(a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

# Question 2

Given the following code:

```js
let cat = {
  name: "Professor X",
  iq: 9000,
  greet: () =>
    console.log(
      "I may be a cat, however with an IQ of " +
        this.iq +
        ", please respect my authority."
    ),
};
```

What will happen and why? Select one or more:

- ❌ It will log the below because arrow functions have their own `this` context

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of 9000, please respect my authority.
```

- ❌ It will throw a reference error because `this.iq` is not defined
- ❌ It will log the below because the function needs to be rewritten to include a parameter in greet to access this:

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of undefined, please respect my authority.
```

- ✅ It will log the below because arrow functions don't have their own `this` context:

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of undefined, please respect my authority.
```

## Why?

In JavaScript, arrow functions inherit the `this` context of the surrounding scope rather than creating their own. As a result, `this.iq` will not refer to `cat.iq` as intended, but instead to an `undefined` this in the outer context

# Question 3

Which of these statements are true about lazy loading images? Select one or more:

- ❌ If I am paying for every byte transferred from my web server, it will cost me more to provide a page with image lazy loading
- ✅ I am making my initial page load faster in the browser.
- ❌ I am reducing the number of images that a user can ever see in my entire page
- ✅ I am controlling when the browser loads the images

# Question 4

Which of these statements about the `IntersectionObserver` API is true? Select one or more:

- ✅ When I am created, I specify the function that the `IntersectionObserver` will run on intersection.
- ❌ In a page where I want to lazy load images, I set the `src` attribute on all the image elements when one of them intersects with the viewport
- ✅ I can define the conditions that trigger the intersection when creating the `IntersectionObserver`.
- ❌ The `IntersectionObserverAPI` is used exclusively for the lazy loading of images.
