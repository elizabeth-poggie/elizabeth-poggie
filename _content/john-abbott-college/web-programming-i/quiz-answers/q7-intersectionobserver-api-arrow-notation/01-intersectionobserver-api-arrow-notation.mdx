# Question 1

Which of the following is the correct way to write an arrow function that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum?

Select one or more:

```js
// ❌
(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

```js
// ❌
function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

```js
// ✅
(a, b) => a + b;
```

```js
// ✅
(a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

# Question 2

Given the following code:

```js
let cat = {
  name: "Professor X",
  iq: 9000,
  greet: () =>
    console.log(
      "I may be a cat, however with an IQ of " +
        this.iq +
        ", please respect my authority."
    ),
};
```

What will happen and why?

Select one or more:

- ❌ It will log the below because arrow functions have their own `this` context

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of 9000, please respect my authority.
```

- ❌ It will throw a reference error because `this.iq` is not defined
- ❌ It will log the below because the function needs to be rewritten to include a parameter in greet to access this:

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of undefined, please respect my authority.
```

- ✅ It will log the below because arrow functions don't have their own `this` context:

```text
I may be a cat, however with an IQ of undefined, please respect my authority.
```

## Why?
