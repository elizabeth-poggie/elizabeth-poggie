# Question 1

In JavaScript, what is the purpose of the Event Loop?

- ❌ To improve execution speed by running all code in many parallel threads
- ❌ To continuously check for tasks, executing synchronous code immediately in the call stack, while asynchronous callbacks are queued and triggered according to priority
- ✅ To control the flow of asynchronous events by executing synchronous code first and then adding asynchronous code later
- ❌ To control memory allocation by clearing unused variables and functions from the call stack

## Why?

This ensures that synchronous code _always_ takes priority, and asynchronous tasks are processed _only when the synchronous code has completed_. This is what makes our code non-blocking so we can continue to accept user interaction.

# Question 2

Why is asynchronous programming useful in web development?

_There are 2 correct answers._

- ✅ It allows the webpage to continue responding to user interactions while tasks are completed in the background
- ✅ It allows JavaScript to handle tasks like data fetching from the server and fancy calculations without freezing the webpage
- ❌ It immediately loads all resources needed for the page
- ❌ It enables code to block the main thread until all tasks are completed, preventing user interactions during processing.

## Why?

Asynchronous programming ensures that long-running tasks do not block the main thread!!

# Question 3

Given the following code:

```js
console.log("A");
setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("C"));
console.log("D");
```

What is the order of execution?

- ❌ A B C D
- ❌ C B A D
- ❌ A D B C
- ✅ A D C B

## Why?

- `console.log()` is a synchronous task and gets executed immediately
- `Promise.resolve().then()` is a microtask and gets executed next
- `setTimeout()` is a macrotask despite only taking 0 seconds at run time

# Question 4

In JavaScript, which of the following are purposes of a reducer function when used with the reduce method?

_There are 2 correct answers:_

- ❌ To transform an array into a new array by applying a function to each element individually
- ✅ To convert an array into other data structures, such as an object or a different array format
- ✅ To accumulate a single output value by applying a function to each element in an array, carrying over the result as it iterates
- ❌ To remove all duplicate values from an array

## Why?

The `reduce` method is very powerful and can transform an array into any data structure, including other objects, arrays, dictionaries, etc. HOWEVER, it's primary purpose is to "reduce" the array to a single value using an accumulator.

# Question 5

What will `arrayTwo` contain?

```js
let arrayOne = [
  { age: 18, id: 1234, program: 420 },
  { age: 19, id: 1456, program: 412 },
  { age: 26, id: 2121, program: 436 },
  { error: true },
];
let arrayTwo = arrayOne.map((x) => {
  return { currentAge: x.age, approximateBirthYear: 2024 - x.age };
});
```

Option A ❌

```js
{
  error: true;
}
```

Option B ✅

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18, approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19, approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26, approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
  { currentAge: undefined, approximateBirthYear: NaN },
];
```

Option C ❌

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
  { currentAge: undefined },
];
```

Option D ❌

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18, approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19, approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26, approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
];
```

## Why?

The `map` method creates a _new array_ by applying a callback function to each element of the original array. If no relevant properties are available, it fills them with the default non values.
