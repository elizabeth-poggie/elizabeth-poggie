# Question 1

In JavaScript, what is the purpose of the Event Loop?

- To improve execution speed by running all code in many parallel threads
- To continuously check for tasks, executing synchronous code immediately in the call stack, while asynchronous callbacks are queued and triggered according to priority
- To control the flow of asynchronous events by executing synchronous code first and then adding asynchronous code later
- To control memory allocation by clearing unused variables and functions from the call stack

## Why?

# Question 2

Why is asynchronous programming useful in web development?

_There are 2 correct answers._

- It allows the webpage to continue responding to user interactions while tasks are completed in the background
- It allows JavaScript to handle tasks like data fetching from the server and fancy calculations without freezing the webpage
- It immediately loads all resources needed for the page
- It enables code to block the main thread until all tasks are completed, preventing user interactions during processing.

## Why?

Given the following code:

```js
console.log("A");
setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("C"));
console.log("D");
```

What is the order of execution?

- A B C D
- C B A D
- A D B C
- A D C B

## Why?

# Question 4

In JavaScript, which of the following are purposes of a reducer function when used with the reduce method?

_There are 2 correct answers:_

- To transform an array into a new array by applying a function to each element individually
- To convert an array into other data structures, such as an object or a different array format
- To accumulate a single output value by applying a function to each element in an array, carrying over the result as it iterates
- To remove all duplicate values from an array

## Why?

# Question 5

What will `arrayTwo` contain?

```js
let arrayOne = [
  { age: 18, id: 1234, program: 420 },
  { age: 19, id: 1456, program: 412 },
  { age: 26, id: 2121, program: 436 },
  { error: true },
];
let arrayTwo = arrayOne.map((x) => {
  return { currentAge: x.age, approximateBirthYear: 2024 - x.age };
});
```

Option A:

```js
{
  error: true;
}
```

Option B:

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18, approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19, approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26, approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
  { currentAge: undefined, approximateBirthYear: NaN },
];
```

Option C:

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26 },
  { approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
  { currentAge: undefined },
];
```

Option D

```js
[
  { currentAge: 18, approximateBirthYear: 2006 },
  { currentAge: 19, approximateBirthYear: 2005 },
  { currentAge: 26, approximateBirthYear: 1998 },
];
```
