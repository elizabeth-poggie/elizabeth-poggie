# Overview

- Worth: This lab will count towards the Assignment portion of your final grade at `7%`
- Due: `September 21 @ 2:00am` - I recommend submitting by `September 20 @ 9:00pm` to ensure good sleep, however for those who thrive under last-minute pressure, you have until later that evening ðŸ‘€
- Hand In: A `.zip` file containing your folder (work) onto LEA.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# Grading Criteria

Refer to here for my generic approach: [Assignment Rubric](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric)

In this Assignment, I will specifically be looking for:

- Inputs: The function takes in the specified inputs.
- Logic: The function logic returns the expected results in all possible scenarios with minimal complexity.
- Outputs: The functions return the expected output.
- Name: Meaningful names, without abbreviations, that relay exactly what the function does or the variables and parameters represent

# Q1 - Cookie Clicker Challenge

`Worth 20 marks`

## The Pitch

Taking inspiration from your Intro to Web development class, you decided to create a competitive cookie clicker game using JavaScript. The game consists of 3 rounds and only the player with the highest cookies per second (CPS) will emerge victorius

## Your Task

Create a JavaScript function that determines the winner of a 3-round cookie-clicking competition. Your function should take in two objects, each representing a player in the competition.

## Object Spec

Each of the two objects your function takes in should have only `three` properties:

- A property that identifies the player (e.g. `name`).
- The number of cookies they start with (an `integer`).
- An array containing the number of cookies clicked in each of the 3 rounds. The first number in the array is the number of cookies clicked in round 1, the second number for round 2, and the third for round 3.

## Function Spec

The value of the property that identifies the player who collected the most cookies in total after the 3 rounds.

## Additional details

- Each round adds to the playerâ€™s total cookies.
- In case of a tie, return "It's a tie!" or another identifier of your choice.

I will invoke and evaluate your function. You may include sample objects you used to test your function if you want to.

## Example IO

Given the sample data:

- Jim ðŸ‘‰ Starting cookies: 10; Cookies clicked per round: [5,8,7]
- Pam ðŸ‘‰ Starting cookies: 15; Cookies clicked per round: [6,7,9]

The function would output:

```text
Winner: Pam ðŸŽ‰
```

This is because:

- Jim's total cookies = 10 + (5 + 8 + 7) = 30
- Pam's total cookies = 15 + (6 + 7 + 9) = 37

Pam has a higher CPS rate compared to Jim and therefore has more cookies.

# Q1 - Anti-Social Networking

`Worth 30 marks`

## The Pitch

You are a founder of an obscure social networking platform that suggests friends based on shared enemies.

```cs
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"
```

Inspired by this ancient proverb, your task is to implement the core features needed to attract funding for your questionable project.

## Your Task

Create a JavaScript function and a user object with inner methods. Your function should take in two user objects.

## Object Spec

Both user objects should have properties for:

- Username: A string representing the user's online handle.
- Join year: The year the user joined the social network.
- Last active year: The last year the user was active (you can choose how to represent someone who is still active).
- Location code: A string representing the user's location (e.g. postal code).
- List of enemies: An array of usernames representing the user's known enemies on the network.

The `FIRST` user object should contain the following methods (inside the object):

- Method 1: Takes in the join year and the last active year of another user and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the two users were active on the social network during the same period.
- Method 2: Takes in another user object and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the two users share any mutual enemies (i.e., if both users have at least one username in their enemies list).

## Function Spec

The main function should determine if the two users are likely to have become allies due to their mutual enemies by returning:

- `null` if the two users are not likely to have interacted online due to lack of mutual enemies or differing active periods.
- A `string` indicating a potential alliance if they share at least one mutual enemy (e.g., "Potential allies due to mutual enemies").

## Example IO

Given the sample data:

- Jim ðŸ‘‰ Joined in 2020; Last active in 2023; Location Code: "SCR"; Enemies: ["Dwight", "Charles Miner"]
- Pam ðŸ‘‰ Joined in 2021; Last active in 2024; Location Code: "SCR"; Enemies: ["Dwight"]

The function would output:

```text
Result: Potential allies due to mutual enemies
```

This is because Jim and Pam share `Dwight` as a common enemy. If Jim and Pam had no mutual enemies or their active periods didnâ€™t overlap, the function would return `null`.
