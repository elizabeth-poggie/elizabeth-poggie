# Overview

- Worth: This lab will count towards the Assignment portion of your final grade at `7%`
- Due: `September 21 @ 2:00am` - I recommend submitting by `September 20 @ 9:00pm` to ensure good sleep, however for those who thrive under last-minute pressure, you have until later that evening ðŸ‘€
- Hand In: A `.zip` file containing your folder (work) onto LEA.
- Late Penalty: Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 3 days. Nothing is accepted after 3 days and a grade of zero will be given.

# Grading Criteria

Refer to here for my generic approach: [Assignment Rubric](https://www.elizabethpoggie.com/notes/john-abbott-college/admin_rubric)

In this Assignment, I will specifically be looking for:

- Inputs: The function takes in the specified inputs.
- Logic: The function logic returns the expected results in all possible scenarios with minimal complexity.
- Outputs: The functions return the expected output.
- Name: Meaningful names, without abbreviations, that relay exactly what the function does or the variables and parameters represent

# Q1 - Cookie Clicker Challenge

## Your task

Create a JavaScript function that determines the winner of a 3-round cookie-clicking competition. Your function should take in two objects, each representing a player in the competition.

## Function

Each of the two objects your function takes in should have only `three` properties:

- A property that identifies the player (e.g. `name`).
- The number of cookies they start with (an `integer`).
- An array containing the number of cookies clicked in each of the 3 rounds. The first number in the array is the number of cookies clicked in round 1, the second number for round 2, and the third for round 3.

## The function returns

The value of the property that identifies the player who collected the most cookies in total after the 3 rounds.

## Additional details

- Each round adds to the playerâ€™s total cookies.
- In case of a tie, return "It's a tie!" or another identifier of your choice.

I will invoke and evaluate your function. You may include sample objects you used to test your function if you want to.

## Example IO

Given the sample data:

- Jim ðŸ‘‰ starting cookies: 10, cookies clicked per round: [5,8,7]
- Pam ðŸ‘‰ starting cookies: 15, cookies clicked per round: [6,7,9]

The function would output:

```text
Winner: Pam ðŸŽ‰
```

Because ...

- Jim's total cookies = 10 + (5 + 8 + 7) = 30
- Pam's total cookies = 15 + (6 + 7 + 9) = 37
