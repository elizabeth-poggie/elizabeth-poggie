# HTML Events

An HTML even can be something the browser does, or something a user does. A few common examples are:

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked

## Common Events

For those that are curious, you can see the full list [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp), however for the purposes of this class here are the ones you will be focusing on:

- `click` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element is clicked.
- `dblclick` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element is double-clicked.
- `change` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the value of an input element has been changed.
- `mouseover` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
- `mouseout` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
- `load` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element (usually an image or script) has finished loading.

## Reacting to Events

What could JavaScript do in response? You could associate some JavaScript code to the occurrence of an event on an HTML element. For example:

```js
<button onclick="doStuff()">What are you doing?</button>
```

here the element attribute `onclick` is going to run the JavaScript method `doStuff()` when the user triggers a `click` event on the `button` element.

```html
<button onclick="doStuff()">What are you doing?</button>
<script>
  function doStuff() {
    alert("I'm doing stuff, excuse you.");
  }
</script>
```

What's happening here is that you are listening for the `click` event to occur in order send your `alert()` to the browser. You are "Listening" for events.
