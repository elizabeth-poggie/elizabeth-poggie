# HTML Events

An HTML even can be something the browser does, or something a user does. A few common examples are:

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked

## Common Events

For those that are curious, you can see the full list [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp), however for the purposes of this class here are the ones you will be focusing on:

- `click` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element is clicked.
- `dblclick` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element is double-clicked.
- `change` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the value of an input element has been changed.
- `mouseover` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
- `mouseout` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
- `load` ðŸ‘‰ Triggered when an element (usually an image or script) has finished loading.

## Reacting to Events

What could JavaScript do in response? You could associate some JavaScript code to the occurrence of an event on an HTML element. For example:

```js
<button onclick="doStuff()">What are you doing?</button>
```

here the element attribute `onclick` is going to run the JavaScript method `doStuff()` when the user triggers a `click` event on the `button` element.

```html
<button onclick="doStuff()">What are you doing?</button>
<p id="stuff"></p>
<script>
  function doStuff() {
    document.getElementById("stuff").innerHTML = "I'm doing stuff, excuse you.";
  }
</script>
```

What's happening here is that you are "listening" for the `click` event to occur in order send your `alert()` to the browser.

## Event Listeners

Instead of specifying it on an attribute in the HTML, you could add an event listener to a given event on an object (the document, a specific HTML element, etc.) all in JavaScript:

```html
<button>What are you doing?</button>
<p id="stuff"></p>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("click", function () {
    document.getElementById("stuff").innerHTML = "I'm doing stuff, excuse you.";
  });
</script>
```

## Arts & Crafts

Why is this so cool? well now we can have a lot more fun creating interactive web pages. Let's say we have the below HTML page with a sad cat:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cat Pat Demo</title>
    <style>
      #cat {
        width: 200px;
        height: auto;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img id="cat" src="./sad-cat.jpg" alt="sad cat" />
  </body>
</html>
```

However we want to dynamically change the image url to a cat being petted upon `mouseenter`. Well we can do that :^) Add the below code to the `<script>` section:

```js
const image = document.getElementById("cat");
image.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
  image.src = "./pet-cat.png";
});
```

However this approach is still incomplete. we need to change the image back to the original upon `mouseleave`.

```js
image.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
  image.src = "./sad-cat.jpg";
});
```

Purfection. However now there is room to clean up our code so the solution is more maintainable. Lets do that:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cat Pat Demo</title>
    <style>
      #cat {
        width: 200px;
        height: auto;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img id="cat" src="./sad-cat.jpg" alt="sad cat" />
    <script>
      const image = document.getElementById("cat");
      const sadCatSrc = "./sad-cat.jpg";
      const happyCatSrc = "./pet-cat.png";

      image.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
        image.src = happyCatSrc;
      });

      image.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
        image.src = sadCatSrc;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
