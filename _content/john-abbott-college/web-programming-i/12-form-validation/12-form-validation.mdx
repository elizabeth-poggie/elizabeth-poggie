# Forms

All user interaction requires validation. Users should be prevented from adding trash as input to prevent unexpected program behavior.

## Why?

There are three main reasons:

- We want to get the right data, in the right format.
- We want to protect our users' data. (e.g. secure passwords)
- We want to protect ourselves. (e.g. nasty users)

## Validation MATTERS

Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. For example, without input validation the user experience is impacted:

```text
❌ BAD - no input validation ❌

(client) 💻 🗑️ -- POST --> 🗑️ 🗃️ (server wondering why you gave it trash)
```

By factoring in client-side form validation, it helps ensure data submitted matches the expected inputs and or requirements. This improves the user experience because by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away:

```text
✅ GOOD - input validation ✅

(client) 💻 🗑️ -- 🛑 (nope) -- POST --> 🗃️ (server has no knowledge of the occurrence of trash)
```

Another way to think about this is instead of sending an emotionally driven text to a friend and them wondering why you are being nasty:

```text
❌ BAD - you did not account for your target audience ❌

(you) 🧑 🗑️ -- POST --> 🗑️ 💑 (your loved ones)
```

You can run it by ChatGPT to reformat the text, ensuring it's constructive:

```text
✅ GOOD - you can now refactor what you want to say ✅

(you) 🧑 🗑️ -- 🛑 (ChatGPT) --> 💑 (your loved ones)
```

These principals not only help you maintain relationships with the people you care about, but they also serve to proactively address any errors in form submissions before they occur :^)

# Form Attributes

Forms are composed of 3 different parts:

- `action` 👉 Specifies what action to perform when the form is submitted. This is usually a URL where the form data should be sent. (e.g. to a server)
- `target` 👉 Defines where the result of the form submission will be displayed. For example, you can open the result in a new tab or in the current window.
- `method` 👉 Specifies the HTTP method to use when submitting the form, either GET or POST.

## What does this look like in the code?

```html
<!-- Notice the 3 parts below -->
<form action="submit-form.php" target="_blank" method="post">
  <!-- other form content here -->
</form>
```

## Explanation

- `action="submit-form.php"` 👉 When the form is submitted, the data will be sent to `submit-form.php`.
- `target="_blank"` 👉 The result will open in a new tab.
- `method="post"` 👉 The form will use the POST method, which sends the data securely without including it in the URL.

# GET vs POST

But what does "GET" mean? What does "POST" mean? For now what you need to know is:

- "GET", retries data
- "POST", sends data

Another way to think of this concept is that you want to put a message in an old school envelope, you're either sending it to a specific address or receiving it from one.

```text
✉️ -- POST --> 📫 @ address

✉️ <-- GET -- 📫 @ address
```

Going back to our course content, the 'address' corresponds to a URL where the 'server' or 'backend' resides, and the 'method' indicates whether we're sending ('POST') or receiving ('GET') data.

```text
✉️ -- POST --> 🗃️ @ url

✉️ <-- GET -- 🗃️ @ url
```

In our example, our "url" is `submit-form.php`, our method is `post`, and the data we are sending is the result of a user data submission.

## What does the data look like when it's being sent?

Well it depends:

- With a GET method the data is submitted and visible in the URL bar (i.e. to the user).
- With a POST method, the data is encoded in the `html` request body and can be encrypted (with `https`).

As a general rule: ALWAYS use POST if the form data contains sensitive information. Why? you don't want a users password, email, phone number to be leaked.

Would you trust your friends with all your social media credentials? Would you trust your family? Your partner even? This is why we us POST requests. What people don't know, it can't be used against you :^)
