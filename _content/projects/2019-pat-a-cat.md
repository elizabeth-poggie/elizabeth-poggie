Pat-a-cat was inspired when Aidon Lebar said "all i want to do is pet cats" and from there started a story of heroism as David Lougheed, Allan Wang, and Elizabeth Poggie made it happen. In the corners of McHacks 2019, you could witness the cats being drawn, meows being recorded, and code being coded.

In this game you can compete against your friends to pat as many cats as you can using keyboard controls. Our team designed the game with the intent to help you relax to some lofi hip hop beats and pat some cats to break from the stress of everyday life. Once a cat is patted, you get to listen to the happy meows of hackers, sponsors, and coordinators of the event.

Our team went on to win best design and runner up for the popularity contest.
