### Hello World, I'm Poggie ðŸŒ»

I'm a software developer with a passion for coaching && coordination. Since 2019, I've been merging my development skills with my passion by working on highly interdisciplinary projects. In the right environment, I like to blend creativity into my work by incorporating my own artistic touch.
