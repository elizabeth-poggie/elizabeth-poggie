# Hello World, I'm Poggie üë©‚Äçüíª

I am currently a lecturer @ John Abbott College, the community manager @ March√© Sainte-Anne, and a freelance artist.

## About

Since 2019, I've been merging my technical expertise with my love of problem-solving by working on highly interdisciplinary projects. In the right environment, I like to blend creativity into my work by adding my own artistic touch.

When I am not hidden away in the corners of Penfield, you'll often spot me at a farmers market, creating another strange piece of art or biting off more work than I can chew (again)

## Values

If i valued my own personal agenda, I wouldn‚Äôt find myself in half the situations I currently handle. My goal is to support those under my charge by placing them in the best possible positions, preventing the darker sides of their personalities from exposure. We are all human with our own issues, needs, limits, and mistakes. The last thing I'll do is use that against you.

Instead, I'll challenge you to strive for the best version of yourself, choosing honest conflict over dishonest harmony. Mistakes are opportunities for growth, and resilience is the cornerstone of success. While I may not be able to solve your problems for you, I'll certainly find ways to inspire\* you :)

## Style

My leadership style is culture-driven and people-oriented. A thriving environment can only be maintained by sticking to our values and not losing sight of what matters most, our people.
