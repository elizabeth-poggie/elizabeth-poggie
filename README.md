# Hello World, I'm Poggie 👩‍💻

I am currently a lecturer @ John Abbott College, the community manager @ Marché Sainte-Anne, and a freelance artist.

## About

Since 2019, I've been merging my technical expertise with my love of problem-solving by working on highly interdisciplinary projects. In the right environment, I like to blend creativity into my work by adding my own artistic touch.

When I am not hidden away in the corners of Penfield, you'll often spot me at a farmers market, creating another strange piece of art or biting off more work than I can chew (again)
